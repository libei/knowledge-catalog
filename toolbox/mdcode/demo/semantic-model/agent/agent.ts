// something about this business has to be written here, the model was missing
// it and the fix belongs there.
//
// The judge is a capability rather than a policy: it can settle a rule stated
// in words, and WHICH rules it is asked are the ones the model names in
// `guards`. So supplying one here says nothing about commerce, the same way
// supplying a database connection does not. The same goes for letting it read:
// what it may read is derived from the model, and which rules make it read is
// decided by how they are worded.

//    tables are derived from the model under this profile, so this line adds a

// derived tool comes from the derivation. The one thing added is today's date.
