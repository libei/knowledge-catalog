// How a model's ACTIONS are encoded in Knowledge Catalog.
//
// An action is published exactly the way a metric is: one entry per action,
// parented to the model anchor, carrying one aspect that holds the executor and
// the typed parameters. What differs is the type. Every other construct has a
// built-in system type, and an action does not, so it uses the custom
// `semantic-action` pair DECLARED IN kc_custom_types.ts and created there by
// `kcmd init --semantic-model`. That file is the list of what is custom; this
// one is only the encoding that fills the aspect.
//
// The custom pair is what makes an action explicit in the catalog. A search can
// tell an action apart from anything else by its entry type, and the aspect's
// fields are typed and queryable rather than prose a reader has to interpret.
//
// WHEN A BUILT-IN ACTION TYPE SHIPS, follow the instructions at the top of
// kc_custom_types.ts. Nothing in this file changes: the readers below match a
// type by its id suffix, so they do not care which project it lives in.
//
// The call sites are `knowledge_catalog.ts` (emit the entries),
// `kc_converter.ts` (read them back), and `pull_kc.ts` (hydrate the aspect).
//
// `instructions` rides the action's own aspect rather than the built-in
// `guidelines` aspect that an entity or metric uses. A pull derives which
// aspect types to hydrate from the project the ENTRY type lives in, so an
// action entry, whose type is custom and therefore in the destination project,
// would ask for a `guidelines` aspect type that only exists under
// `dataplex-types`. Keeping the field on the action's own aspect keeps the
// whole encoding inside the one type kc_custom_types.ts provisions.
//
// The helpers at the bottom duplicate a few lines from the modules above on
// purpose. This module imports only the IR, the entry shape and the type
// registry, so it can be swapped or deleted as a unit.
