// The semantic runtime: executing a model's action against a live store.
//
// A semantic model has always described what things MEAN. Actions describe what
// can be DONE. This module is where the two meet an actual database:
//
//   1. RESOLVE. An action's parameters are typed by the ontology, so an
//      entity-typed argument is an object reference, not a value. The caller
//      (often an agent) supplies something human -- an account id, a person's
//      name -- and the runtime turns it into the row that argument denotes,
//      failing loudly on "no such thing" and on "more than one such thing".
//   2. BIND. Every argument becomes a query parameter of the store type its
//      declared ontology type implies. Nothing is interpolated into SQL.
//   3. APPLY. A read-write transaction is opened, the action's writes are run
//      inside it, and it is committed. Any failure before the commit rolls
//      back, so no partial write survives. A failure OF the commit is the one
//      case nothing here can resolve -- the store may have applied it and lost
//      the response -- and it is reported as the unknown it is rather than as
//      a rollback.
//
// Where the write comes from. An action with a `sql` executor carries its own
// DML, and the runtime runs those statements itself. An action with an `mcp`,
// `rest` or `grpc` executor names an operation that lives in another system,
// which this module cannot call and could not roll back if it did; for those
// the caller supplies a handler that produces the statements.
//
// Where the model's rules come in. A constraint takes effect here through
// `guards` on the action: each rule the action names becomes one check and is
// run inside this same transaction -- before the write when it reads one of the
// call's arguments, after the write when it reads only stored state -- and a
// violation rolls the whole thing back and reports the rule's own words. See
// ./constraints.
//
// A rule that cannot be lowered REFUSES the action rather than letting it run
// unchecked. A model that declares a rule and a runtime that quietly ignores it
// is worse than no runtime at all, because the model states the call is checked
// and nothing says otherwise.
//
// A constraint no action names gates nothing here, because it gates nothing
// anywhere: a rule takes effect where something references it, and `guards` is
// that reference for an action (see Action.guards in ir.ts). Checking a
// constraint that merely reads data the action writes would mean publishing a
// rule silently stopped calls that succeeded the day before, which is the
// property that reference rule exists to guarantee.
