/**
 * Turning a model into agent tools.
 *
 * An action declares everything a write tool needs: a name, a description of
 * what it does, its typed parameters, the guidance an AI caller should follow
 * (`ai_context.instructions`), and the rules that gate it. This module reads
 * that out and hands back plain descriptions of the tools, each with a
 * function that runs it.
 *
 * The description is framework-neutral on purpose. Nothing here imports an
 * agent framework, so binding these to Google ADK, to LangChain, or to an MCP
 * server is a short adapter the caller writes, and adding a second framework
 * costs nothing in this file.
 *
 * What this module does NOT do is decide anything. A tool built here is a way
 * to ask. Every refusal is decided by runAction, and an agent that calls a
 * tool it should not have gets back an outcome it has to report rather than a
 * knob it can turn.
 *
 * What the runtime can settle shows through here, because it decides which
 * tools are worth handing out. Every guard is settled by asking a judge, so
 * passing one in is what makes a guarded action callable at all; without one
 * runAction refuses rather than running the write unchecked. A tool for an
 * action that would be refused every time it was called is a bad thing to hand
 * a caller that cannot see why. So a tool carries `runnable`, and an adapter
 * binds the ones that are; the rest are still returned, named and explained,
 * because an action the model declares should not vanish from a listing of
 * what the model declares.
