// Asking something other than the store whether a rule holds.
//
// A `judgment` states a rule in words, for the rules no expression decides:
// *the credit memo must name a specific service failure* is a real requirement
// with a real owner, and no arithmetic settles it. What answers one is a
// language model reading the attempted call against the rule's own text.
//
// This file is the seam and nothing else. It names what a judge is asked and
// what it must answer, so the runtime can plan, run and report a judged rule
// with no model client on the library's dependency list -- the arrangement
// agent_tools.ts already makes for agent frameworks. Implementations live
// outside: gcp/gemini.ts has one, and a caller may pass its own.
