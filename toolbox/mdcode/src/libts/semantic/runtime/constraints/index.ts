// Checking an action's guards against a live deployment.
//
// A constraint is a logical invariant over the ontology (`Order.total >= 0`,
// `amount <= Order.total`). An action that names one in `guards` claims the
// rule holds of every call it makes, and this package is what makes the claim
// true: each named constraint becomes one check, run inside the action's own
// transaction, so a rule that does not hold rolls the write back and no
// violating state is ever visible to another reader.
//
// The package is laid out along the two ways a check varies, and they are
// independent:
//
//   * WHAT SETTLES THE RULE. A constraint declares exactly one body and the
//     body says who answers it. An `expression` is answered by the store
//     (sql_check.ts); a `judgment` is answered by a language model reading the
//     attempted call (judgment.ts). CHECKERS below maps one to the other,
//     keyed by the IR's own CONSTRAINT_EVALUATIONS, so a third body cannot be
//     added to the model without this map failing to compile. What a judge IS
//     is declared in judge.ts and supplied by the caller, so no model client
//     reaches this package's dependency list.
//   * HOW A STORE IS ASKED. One rule, one meaning, more than one language to
//     write it in: GoogleSQL over the entity's own table today, GQL over the
//     pushed property graph next, whatever a future engine reads after that.
//     dialect.ts holds that axis alone. Nothing outside it -- not the grammar,
//     not the timing, not the refusals -- changes when a dialect is added.
//
// Everything a check needs to be DECIDED is settled before a session opens and
// with no argument values in hand (analysis.ts, bind.ts), which is what lets
// one call answer both "may this action be offered at all" and "what shall I
// run". The advertised verdict and the real one cannot drift, because they are
// the same answer.
//
// The property that outranks expressive power: planning FAILS CLOSED. A
// constraint this package cannot turn into a check does not quietly pass. It
// returns a reason, and the runtime refuses the action rather than running it
// unchecked, because a gate that lets writes through is worse than no gate --
// it is believed.

 * and the advisory rules it had to leave unevaluated. A non-empty `errors`
 * means the action cannot be run: the model says the call is checked, and a
 * check that cannot be performed is not one.
 *
 * An ADVISORY rule -- `on_violation: warn` -- is the exception, and it is
 * `unchecked` rather than an error. It reports and lets the write through, so
 * being unable to evaluate it costs the caller a report and stops nothing;
 * refusing over it would turn a rule the author wrote as advice into the one
 * thing that makes the action unrunnable. It is still named, because a report
