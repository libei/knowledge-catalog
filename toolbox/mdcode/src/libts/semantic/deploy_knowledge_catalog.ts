// Deploys a semantic model's Knowledge Catalog resources.
//
// This is the Knowledge Catalog leg of `kcmd push` for the semantic-model
// scope, the counterpart to `deploy_bigquery.ts`. It consumes models already
// parsed into the semantic IR (see loadSemanticModels, shared with the BigQuery
// leg so a multi-destination push parses each document once), maps each to catalog
// Entries + Aspects (the pure emitter in knowledge_catalog.ts), and writes them
// through the Knowledge Catalog client.
//
// Types: the `semantic-model`/`semantic-entity`/`semantic-metric` entry and
// aspect types — and the built-in `schema` aspect — are built-in system types
// in `dataplex-types/global`. Push does NOT provision any type, nor the entry
// group (that is created at `init`); it only writes entries. The caller needs
// `dataplex.entryGroups.useSemanticModelAspect` on the destination entry group.
//
// Publish sequence (mirrors the BigQuery leg's structure):
//   * Create each model's entries in array order: the semantic-model anchor
//     first (it is the parentEntry of every entity/metric entry), then the
//     children concurrently. No entry-group or type creation -- the entry
//     group is provisioned at `init` and the system types are built-in.
//   * A re-push upserts: an entry that already exists is updated in place.
//   * Reconcile deletions: an entity or metric removed from a still-present
//     model leaves an orphaned entry under its anchor; after writing, delete
//     any entry this push owns (by entry-id prefix) that was not re-emitted.
//   * Relationship edges are published as schema-join entry links between the
//     two entity entries, written after that model's entries (both endpoints
//     must exist first). A re-push upserts the link's aspect; a many-to-many
//     (association) edge is not published yet (the emitter warns and skips it).
//     The caller additionally needs `dataplex.entryGroups.useSchemaJoinEntryLink`
//     and `useSchemaJoinAspect` on the destination entry group.
//
// This is a library module: it emits no console output. Warnings and the
// dry-run plan are returned in `KcDeployResult` for the CLI (commands.ts) to
// print.
