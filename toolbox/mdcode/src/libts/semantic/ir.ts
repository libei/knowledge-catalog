 *
 * An engine reading the catalog needs this in order to route. Without it every
 * rule publishes with the same shape, and a $30 credit that needs a supervisor
 * is indistinguishable from one that is simply forbidden.
 *
 * This is a disposition, not a magnitude, and the two are deliberately separate
 * keys. `escalate` is not "between" reject and warn on a scale of badness: it is
 * a different control flow, and what it really states is that an approver
 * exists. Two rules can be equally grave -- both guarding a million-dollar write
 * -- and differ only in whether anyone in the organization is entitled to say
 * yes. See CONSTRAINT_SEVERITIES for the magnitude.
 *
 * `escalate` names that an approver exists. It does not name who: an approver
 * role is not modeled yet.
 *
 * The consequence is a field rather than something a `judgment` states in its
 * own prose, because three things need it without running a judge. An
 * unrunnable judge -- none configured, a failed call, a timeout -- still has to
 * route the breach it could not evaluate. A search for the rules that can stop
 * a write cannot read prose. And a policy DSL states its effect in the rule
 * head, so a rule whose consequence is only implied by its wording cannot be
 * lowered into OPA or Cedar.
 *
 * A judgment may declare any of the three, `reject` included. What settles a
 * judgment can decide two identical proposals differently, and `reject` leaves
 * no appeal, so that pairing is the riskiest thing this model can express. It
 * is still a bet an organization is entitled to place, and refusing to
 * represent it would move the policy out of the catalog rather than prevent it.
 * It is made auditable instead: `evaluation` publishes `judged` beside the
 * word, so "unappealable rules settled by a model" is one query. `onViolation`
 * is required on a judgment rather than defaulted, because a forgotten word
 * would produce exactly that pairing silently.
 *
 * A constraint's word is the consequence of the one condition it states. A

 * language model can still decide two identical proposals differently, and no
 * schema changes that. `onViolation` is required on a judgment so that the
 * consequence of that non-determinism is always stated rather than inherited.
 *
 * STATUS: authored, validated and published; not yet enforced. kcmd carries a
 * constraint to Knowledge Catalog, where an agent can read the rules a model
 * requires. No component evaluates one, so nothing today rejects a write that
 * would break it. Enforcement is the point of declaring them: an operational
 * agent running an action writes to a live store, and a bad write corrupts
 * data. The rule has to be stated and governed before it can be checked.
 *
 * `description` is the error text a violation would surface, so write it to
 * steer an agent's next move -- "reduce the order quantity or choose another
 * customer" -- rather than to label the rule.

  // Exactly one of `expression` and `judgment`. Declaring neither, or both, is
  // a hard load error: the pair is what tells a consumer whether the rule can
  // be computed, and a constraint that answers both ways answers neither.
  expression?: string;  // boolean invariant in the model's expression language
  // The rule in words, for a rule no expression decides. Write field names
  // model-qualified (`LineItem.memo` rather than "the memo"): validate resolves
  // every `Entity.field` token in the text, so the reference is checked, and it
  // lives in the sentence that uses it rather than in a second list that drifts
  // from the prose beside it. States one condition, in the form of what must be
  // true rather than what to do, and says what does not satisfy it: a policy
  // with several conditions goes in several constraints, regrouped by `guards`
  // on the action. The consequence goes in `onViolation`, not the prose.
  judgment?: string;
  description?: string;  // human-readable summary; also the violation error
  // What a violation of this constraint does to the write. On an `expression`
  // it defaults to `reject`: an unmarked rule refuses the write, which is the
  // safe reading of an author who did not say. On a `judgment` it is required,
  // any of the three words, because inheriting the harshest one by silence is
  // not a thing to do to a rule a model settles. See VIOLATION_EFFECTS.
  onViolation?: ViolationEffect;
  // How grave a violation is, for ranking and reporting. Orthogonal to
  // `onViolation`, and carries no default -- an author who did not say has not
  // said, and nothing reads it yet. See CONSTRAINT_SEVERITIES.
  severity?: ConstraintSeverity;
  aiContext?: AiContext;
  // No `customExtensions`. Every other IR object has one because vanilla Ossie
  // accepts `custom_extensions` on it. A constraint is unreachable that way:
  // `constraints` is an extended-profile-only key, and the extended profile
  // rejects `custom_extensions` outright (ceField in loader.ts), so no document
  // can carry both. Should vanilla Ossie ever gain constraints, add the field
  // back with `...ce` on the schema.
