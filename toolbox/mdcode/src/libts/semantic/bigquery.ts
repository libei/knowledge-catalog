// Generates BigQuery property-graph DDL (with inline measures) from the
// Semantic Model IR.
//
// The IR (./ir) is pure semantics. This module is one of its consumers: it
// emits a single `CREATE OR REPLACE PROPERTY GRAPH` statement over the
// entities' existing base tables, with model-level metrics rendered as inline
// `MEASURE(...)` properties.
//
// BigQuery graph measures bind an aggregate to exactly one table's KEY; the
// cross-entity rollup happens at query time via GRAPH_EXPAND(...) + AGG(...).
// A metric therefore lands on whichever single table its aggregate columns
// reference; a metric whose aggregate genuinely spans multiple tables cannot be
// expressed as one MEASURE and is skipped (reported in `warnings`).
//
// A measure can only aggregate an EXPOSED PROPERTY of its node (not a raw
// column or an inline expression), so each metric is lowered into a derived
// operand property plus a MEASURE over it (see placeMetric / exposeOperand).
//
// See: https://docs.cloud.google.com/bigquery/docs/graph-measures
