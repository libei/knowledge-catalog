/**
 * Turning a model into agent tools.
 *
 * An agent needs two things from a model: a way to look at what is there, and
 * a way to change it. Both are already declared.
 *
 * An action declares everything a write tool needs: a name, a description of
 * what it does, its typed parameters, the guidance an AI caller should follow
 * (`ai_context.instructions`), and the rules that gate it. An entity plus its
 * binding profile declares everything a read tool needs: the fields, and the
 * table and columns they resolve to. This module reads both out and hands back
 * plain descriptions of the tools, each with a function that runs it.
 *
 * The description is framework-neutral on purpose. Nothing here imports an
 * agent framework, so binding these to Google ADK, to LangChain, or to an MCP
 * server is a short adapter the caller writes, and adding a second framework
 * costs nothing in this file. See demo/agent/agent.ts for the ADK adapter,
 * which is a dozen lines.
 *
 * What this module does NOT do is decide anything. A tool built here is a way
 * to ask. Every refusal is decided by runAction, and an agent that calls a
 * tool it should not have gets back an outcome it has to report rather than a
 * knob it can turn.
 *
 * One thing the runtime cannot yet do shows through here. Nothing evaluates a
 * constraint, so runAction refuses any action that names one in `guards`
 * rather than running it unchecked. A tool for such an action would fail every
 * time it was called, which is a bad thing to hand a caller that cannot see
 * why. So a tool carries `runnable`, and an adapter binds the ones that are;
 * the rest are still returned, named and explained, because an action the
 * model declares should not vanish from a listing of what the model declares.
