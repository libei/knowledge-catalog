// How a model's CONSTRAINTS are encoded in Knowledge Catalog.
//
// One entry per constraint, parented to the model anchor, carrying one aspect
// that holds the invariant. An action is published the same way. Dataplex has
// no built-in constraint type, so the entry and aspect types are the custom
// `semantic-constraint` pair, declared in kc_custom_types.ts and created by
// `kcmd init --semantic-model`. That file lists what is custom; this one holds
// the encoding that fills the aspect.
//
// An entry of its own is what makes the invariant governable. A search can list
// every rule a model states, whichever way the rule is settled. Dropping a
// constraint from the model deletes its entry, so the catalog never advertises
// a rule the model stopped requiring.
//
// The six authored fields land in two places. `expression`, `judgment`,
// `on_violation`, `severity` and `ai_context` go on the aspect, the last whole
// -- aiContextField in kc_custom_types.ts says why. `description` goes on the
// entry source, where a pull of an action already reads it, and because a
// violation quotes that sentence back to the caller as the error, which makes
// it the entry's summary.
//
// A constraint states its rule in one of those first two fields and never in
// both: `expression` for a rule a query can compute, `judgment` for one only a
// reader can settle. The aspect adds a seventh field, `evaluation`, which no
// author writes -- it restates which body the constraint used, as the word
// `deterministic` or `judged`, so a consumer picking rules to lower into SQL
// and a consumer picking rules to hand a language-model judge each select on
// one field instead of testing which body is populated. A pull reads the
// bodies and recomputes the word, so the two can never disagree in the IR.
//
// Both routing words are on the aspect because they are machine-readable, and
// they are two fields because they answer different questions: what the engine
// does about a breach, and how grave the breach is. A constraint that states
// neither is published without them and reads back the same way, so a default
// stays the IR's to define and a pull never invents a value the model never
// stated.
//
// Call sites: knowledge_catalog.ts emits the entries, kc_converter.ts reads
// them back, pull_kc.ts hydrates the aspect.
//
// WHEN A BUILT-IN CONSTRAINT TYPE SHIPS, follow the instructions at the top of
// kc_custom_types.ts. Nothing in this file changes, because the readers below
// match a type by its id suffix and ignore the project it lives in.
//
// The helpers at the bottom repeat a few lines from the modules above on
// purpose. This module imports only the IR, the entry shape and the type
// registry, so it can be swapped or deleted as a unit.
