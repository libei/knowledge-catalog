// A `judgment` gets the same field-reference check over the qualified tokens in
// its prose, plus the one routing rule in judgedConstraintErrors.
//
// Both bodies are scanned the same way, because a rule is as easy to misspell
// in `amount <= Order.totl` as in a sentence, and an expression that names a

// compound logic. A valid constraint must never be falsely rejected.

//   - Inheritance is still AS DECLARED. `extends` is flattened by the graph
//     legs, which run after this gate, so a subtype's `fields` here omit every
//     field it inherits. Looking the field up on the resolved model fixes that.
//   - A profile push has already pruned unbound fields (`fieldsPruned`). The
//     author's field is gone from the model, and resolving does not bring it
