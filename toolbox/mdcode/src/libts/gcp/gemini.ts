// The runtime defines what a judge is (semantic/runtime/constraints/judge.ts)
// and this supplies one, the same way spanner.ts supplies a store. It is one
// `generateContent` call over the REST surface every other client here uses,
// so it needs no SDK on the dependency list and authenticates the way the rest
// of the tool does.
//
// What it will not do is reason about the model. A judge is handed one rule
// and one attempted call and answers about that pair only, because a rule the
// catalog governs has to mean the same thing for every caller and a prompt
// that invited the model to consider anything else would stop being auditable.
