# Modeling write operations

A semantic model says what the data means, and its metrics say what can be read
from it. An **action** is the write-side counterpart: a named operation that
changes state, declared over the same concepts as everything else in the model.

An action does not contain the write. It names the operation, types the
operation's inputs against the ontology, and says which concepts the call
changes. It also points at the **executor** that performs it — an MCP tool, a
REST endpoint, a gRPC method, or DML — which is the one physical part of an
action, and so may come from a binding profile rather than the model.
Publishing it puts the
operation in the same place as the data it acts on, so an agent that discovers
the model discovers what it can do as well as what it can ask.

## When to use it

Declare an action when your organization already has an operation that changes
the data this model describes, and you want that operation described where the
data is described. Anything reading the model then knows the operation exists,
what it takes, and where it lives.

An action does not answer a question about the data. Use a
[metric](README.md#1-author-the-logical-model) for that.

## 1. Declare the action

Actions sit at model level, beside metrics, and each one carries a name, an
executor, and its parameters:

```yaml
version: "0.2.0.dev0/google"    # `actions` is a kcmd extension key
semantic_model:
  - name: payments
    entities:
      - name: Account
        primary_key: [accountId]
        source: my-project.bank.account
        fields:
          - { name: accountId,      datatype: Integer, expression: account_id }
          - { name: name,           datatype: String,  expression: name }
          - { name: balance,        datatype: Float,   expression: balance }
          - { name: minimumBalance, datatype: Float,   expression: minimum_balance }
          - { name: status,         datatype: String,  expression: status }
      - name: Transfer
        primary_key: [transferId]
        source: my-project.bank.transfer
        fields:
          - { name: transferId, datatype: Integer, expression: transfer_id }
          - { name: amount,     datatype: Float,   expression: amount }
          - { name: debitedId,  datatype: Integer, expression: debited_account_id }
    relationships:
      - name: TransferDebits
        from: Transfer
        to: Account
        from_columns: [debitedId]
        to_columns: [accountId]
    actions:
      - name: TransferFunds
        description: Move money from one account to another.
        executor:                             # exactly one kind: mcp / rest / grpc / sql
          mcp:
            server: //agentregistry.googleapis.com/projects/acme-ops/locations/us-central1/mcpServers/payments
            tool: transfer_funds
        parameters:
          - { name: source, type: Account }   # an entity: an object reference
          - { name: target, type: Account }
          - { name: amount, type: Float }     # a scalar: an ordinary value
        ai_context:
          instructions: >-
            Resolve both accounts before calling. Name the account the money
            leaves as `source`.
```

The rest of the model — the deployment target, the entity bindings, the
relationships — is authored as it is for any model; see
[Deploying a semantic model](README.md).

The executor says where the operation lives. `mcp` (`{server, tool}`) references
a tool already registered in Agent Registry by the server's resource name plus
the tool's name within it. `rest` (`{endpoint, method}`) and `grpc`
(`{service, method}`) are the other two remote kinds. A fourth, `sql`, carries
the write itself rather than a pointer to whoever performs it — see
[Writing the statements in the model](#writing-the-statements-in-the-model).
Exactly one kind, where an executor is written at all.

`description` and `ai_context.instructions` are both carried through to the
catalog. Write the instructions for the agent that will call the action, as
above.

### The executor is a binding, and may come from a profile

Everything else an action declares is logical — what it takes, what gates it,
what it changes. The executor is not: it is *how* the change is carried out,
which depends on the store. Where the rows sit in a relational database the
write is DML; where they do not, it is a call to whoever owns them. Even two
relational stores differ, each with its own table names and dialect.

So the executor is a physical binding, like an entity's `source`, and a [binding
profile](profiles.md) may supply or replace it:

```yaml
# commerce.profiles/operational.yaml — this store owns the rows, so it writes them
semantic_model:
  - name: payments
    actions:
      - name: TransferFunds
        executor:
          sql:
            statements:
              - UPDATE account SET balance = balance - @amount WHERE account_id = @source
              - UPDATE account SET balance = balance + @amount WHERE account_id = @target
```

An action the profile does not mention keeps whatever the model declared, so the
executor written above serves as the default and a profile overrides only the
stores that perform the write differently. `executor: null` in a profile
withdraws it — a read-only binding that performs no writes at all.

Writing no executor anywhere is allowed. The action is then **declared but not
performable**: it still states what it does, what gates it, and what it changes,
which is the whole of what a reader needs. A catalog-only push (`--no-profile`,
or a model with no deployment target) publishes it like any other action.
`kcmd profiles` lists it under `cannot run:` for each binding that supplies no
executor for it.

A push that also deploys a graph is different, and in the same way it already is
for metrics: the catalog entries reflect the binding that was pushed, pruned to
what it can do. An action that binding cannot perform is absent from them, and
because the model owns its action entries for delete reconciliation, pushing
that binding removes an entry an earlier push published. Choose the binding
whose view of the model the catalog should hold — `default_profile` in
`catalog.yaml` — as you would for a metric only one store can answer.

### What an entity-typed parameter adds

A hand-written tool schema can say that an input is an integer or a string. A
parameter typed against the model says what the input *denotes*:

> **A parameter typed by an entity is an object reference.**

`{name: source, type: Account}` says the argument names an account, so a
consumer generating a tool schema knows to accept an identifier and resolve it
against `Account`'s key rather than pass a number through. A parameter typed by
a scalar datatype, such as `amount` above, is an ordinary value.

### Writing the statements in the model

The three kinds above name a system that performs the write, so what the write
does is opaque to the model: it states an `affects` list and nothing can check
that list against reality. The fourth kind, `sql`, contains the write instead.

```yaml
      - name: TransferFunds
        executor:
          sql:
            statements:
              - UPDATE account SET balance = balance - @amount WHERE account_id = @source
              - UPDATE account SET balance = balance + @amount WHERE account_id = @target
        parameters:
          - { name: source, type: Account }
          - { name: target, type: Account }
          - { name: amount, type: Float }
        affects:
          - { concept: Account, operation: modify, fields: [balance] }
```

#### The statements are written in database names

Look closely at what those statements say. The entity is `Account` and its field
is `accountId`, but the statement writes `account` and `account_id` — the table
and the column that entity is *bound* to, back in `source` and `expression`.

A model gives everything two names, and a metric is written in the first of them:
you write `Account.balance`, and `kcmd` translates it to `account.balance` before
any SQL reaches the store. **An action's statements are not translated.** They
are handed to the store exactly as written, so every table and column in one
must be the database's own name. The only model names in a statement are the
`@parameter` references, which name the action's declared parameters.

That is the price of carrying the write verbatim: a rewrite is a place where
what runs and what was reviewed could come apart.

Nothing catches a model name before the call. Validation checks that each
statement is one DML verb, contains no `;`, and binds only declared parameters —
it never asks the store whether a table exists. A model name therefore fails at
run time, from the store, and the message is not always legible: an entity named
`Order` bound to a table named `Orders` produces

```
Syntax error: Unexpected keyword ORDER [at 1:8]
```

rather than "no such table", because `ORDER` is a reserved word.

Containing the write buys three things a pointer cannot:

- **The blast radius is checkable.** `affects` can be read against the
  statements rather than taken on trust.
- **A guard becomes a real gate.** An MCP, REST or gRPC call commits inside a
  system `kcmd` does not control, so a check wrapped around it is advisory. A
  statement runs in the caller's own transaction and can be rolled back.
- **The gate sees the write.** The statements run where the constraints are
  probed, so a check observes the uncommitted result of the write it is gating.

The narrowness is what makes that safe, and push enforces it:

- Each statement is a **single `INSERT`, `UPDATE` or `DELETE`**. A statement that
  reads is a query and belongs in a metric; one that reshapes the schema is not
  an action. A `;` inside a statement is rejected, because each list entry runs
  on its own and anything after the separator would silently not run.
- Every value arrives as a **bound `@parameter`** naming a parameter the action
  declares. Nothing is interpolated into the statement text, so an argument
  cannot become SQL.
- There is no control flow, and no statement composed at call time. An action
  whose body arrives with the call declares nothing, and a gate cannot check what
  was never declared.

An action that **creates** a row needs a key for it, and the key cannot come from
the caller: an agent that picks its own primary keys can overwrite an existing
row by choosing one that is already taken. Declare the creation in `affects` and
refer to the generated key as `@new<Concept>Key`:

```yaml
        executor:
          sql:
            statements:
              - >-
                INSERT INTO transfer (transfer_id, amount, debited_account_id)
                VALUES (@newTransferKey, @amount, @source)
        affects:
          - { concept: Transfer, operation: create }
```

A `sql` executor is the only kind `kcmd` itself runs — see
[Run it](#7-run-it). The other three are published and dispatched by whoever
reads the model.

## 2. Gate it with a constraint

A **constraint** is a named rule a model states over its ontology. Declaring one
adds it to the catalog and changes nothing by itself. A constraint takes effect
where something references it and nowhere else, so publishing a rule cannot
silently start refusing calls that succeeded yesterday.

An expression over stored data states a condition the data must satisfy:

```yaml
    constraints:
      - name: BalanceStaysPositive
        expression: Account.balance >= Account.minimumBalance
        description: >-
          An account cannot be taken below its minimum balance.
```

On its own that is a catalogued rule and no more. Nothing consults it, and no
write is refused for breaking it. It acquires effect when an action names it.

An expression that reads an action's **parameters** describes one call rather
than the stored data. The only moment it can be checked is before that call
runs:

```yaml
    constraints:
      - name: AmountIsPositive
        expression: amount > 0
        description: >-
          A transfer must move at least one unit. Ask the caller for the
          amount again before retrying.
    actions:
      - name: TransferFunds
        executor:
          mcp:
            server: //agentregistry.googleapis.com/projects/acme-ops/locations/us-central1/mcpServers/payments
            tool: transfer_funds
        parameters:
          - { name: source, type: Account }
          - { name: target, type: Account }
          - { name: amount, type: Float }
        guards: [AmountIsPositive]
```

`guards` holds the names of constraints the same model declares, and it is how a
constraint acquires effect over an action. Both kinds of rule belong there. One
that reads the action's parameters has no other moment to run. One over stored
data, named as a guard, states that the call must not proceed on data that is
already broken.

Every guard is checked before the call, with the arguments bound. What each rule
reads decides how much that moment can tell you. A rule over the parameters is
settled completely there, since the arguments are the whole of what it reads. A
rule over stored data is a condition on the state a write produces, and checking
it before the call reports only that the call is not starting from a broken
state. It does not report that the call leaves a sound one. Nothing in the model
binds a rule to the result of a write, which is the gap between what a data rule
says and what a guard can enforce.

A rule meant to report rather than block is one that declares `warn`, checked at
the same moment and let through.

Whatever dispatches the call is what checks its guards. Handing a rule to the
store instead works only for some rules. A condition on a single row lowers to a
store-level `CHECK`. One that aggregates across a child table, such as an order
total matching the sum of its line items, lowers to neither Spanner nor
BigQuery.

The reference lives on the action rather than on the constraint, because the
same rule may gate `TransferFunds` and leave `CloseAccount` alone.

`guards` and `on_violation` answer different questions, and both can be set. A
guard says *when* the constraint is checked — before the write, with the
arguments bound. `on_violation` says what a breach does: `reject` refuses the
call, `escalate` holds it for an approver, `warn` reports it and lets the write
proceed. So guarding a constraint that declares `warn` is a real shape rather
than a contradiction: it is how a rule the organization is not yet ready to
block on still gets checked at the moment of the call and reported back.

### When no expression decides it

Some rules a business enforces cannot be written as a boolean. Whether a credit
memo explains the failure it claims to refund, whether a discount is justified
by the reason given — a query can read the text and cannot settle the question.
Such a rule goes in `judgment` instead of `expression`:

```yaml
    constraints:
      - name: CreditMemoNamesAServiceFailure
        judgment: >-
          LineItem.memo must name a specific, verifiable service failure on the
          order: a late delivery, a damaged item, a shipping charge applied in
          error. A memo that states only that the customer requested a credit
          does not satisfy this rule.
        description: >-
          Say what went wrong with the order in the credit memo.
        on_violation: warn
        severity: low
```

A constraint declares one body or the other, never both and never neither. A
judgment must state `on_violation`, and it may state any of the three words.
Leaving the key out is the one thing it may not do: an unmarked constraint
rejects, and that is too strong a consequence to inherit by silence.

### Writing a judgment

A language model reads the sentence at review time with the proposed write in
front of it. Five habits make that reading consistent.

**State what must be true of the data.** Write the condition — *the memo must
name a specific service failure* — rather than the procedure — *check whether
the memo is specific*. The sentence describes a clean write, and everything
about handling a breach lives elsewhere.

**Name fields model-qualified.** Write `LineItem.memo` rather than "the memo".
`kcmd` resolves every `Entity.field` token in the text against the model and
fails the push when the entity declares no such field, so a rename cannot leave
the sentence pointing at nothing. The qualified name also tells the judge
exactly which value to read.

**Say what does not count.** A rule with no negative example is graded against
whatever the model guesses the author had in mind. "A memo that states only that
the customer requested a credit does not satisfy this rule" buys more
consistency than any further description of what a good memo is.

**Leave the consequence out of the prose.** What happens on a breach is
`on_violation`. A judgment ending "…otherwise escalate to a supervisor" states a
routing nothing reads, and the engine routes by the field regardless.

**Keep it to one condition.** When the sentence needs "and also", the second
half is a second constraint. One `on_violation` cannot carry two consequences,
so two conditions that end differently cannot share a constraint.

### A policy whose rules end differently

Real policies have several rules, and the rules rarely end the same way. Take
the policy governing a customer-service credit, stated the way a business states
it:

1. a credit may not exceed the total of the order it credits;
2. a credit over 25 dollars needs a supervisor's decision;
3. an order's total always equals the sum of its line items;
4. the memo on a credit must name a specific service failure;
5. a credit must not be one larger credit split up to stay under the 25-dollar
   limit.

Five rules, three different outcomes, and two of them that no query settles. The
model has an `Order` with a `total`, a `LineItem` with an `amount` and a `memo`,
and an `IssueCredit` action taking the order, the amount and the memo. Each rule
becomes one constraint, carrying its own outcome in its own `on_violation`:

```yaml
    constraints:
      # Rules a query can compute.
      - name: CreditWithinOrderTotal              # rule 1
        expression: amount <= Order.total
        description: >-
          A credit cannot exceed the total of the order it credits. Lower the
          amount, or split it across the orders it actually covers.
        on_violation: escalate
        severity: high

      - name: CreditUnderSelfServiceLimit         # rule 2
        expression: amount <= 25
        description: >-
          A credit over 25 dollars is above the self-service limit. A
          supervisor decides it.
        on_violation: escalate
        severity: medium

      - name: OrderTotalMatchesLineItems          # rule 3
        expression: Order.total == SUM(LineItem.amount)
        description: >-
          An order's total must equal the sum of its line items, with credits
          subtracted.
        on_violation: reject
        severity: critical

      # Rules no query can compute.
      - name: CreditMemoNamesAServiceFailure      # rule 4
        judgment: >-
          LineItem.memo must name a specific, verifiable service failure on the
          order: a late delivery, a damaged item, a shipping charge applied in
          error. A memo that states only that the customer requested a credit
          does not satisfy this rule.
        description: >-
          Say what went wrong with the order in the credit memo.
        on_violation: warn
        severity: low

      - name: CreditIsNotSplitToAvoidReview       # rule 5
        judgment: >-
          A credit must not appear to be one larger credit divided into parts
          that each stay under the 25-dollar self-service limit. Read the
          proposed amount together with the other credits already on the same
          Order: several near-limit credits raised close together for related
          reasons are one credit, whatever each memo says on its own.
        description: >-
          Raise this as a single credit for the full amount and send it for
          supervisor review.
        on_violation: reject
        severity: critical

    actions:
      - name: IssueCredit
        executor:
          mcp:
            server: //agentregistry.googleapis.com/projects/acme-ops/locations/us-central1/mcpServers/commerce
            tool: issue_credit
        parameters:
          - { name: order,  type: Order }
          - { name: amount, type: Decimal }
          - { name: memo,   type: String }
        guards:
          - CreditWithinOrderTotal
          - CreditUnderSelfServiceLimit
          - OrderTotalMatchesLineItems
          - CreditMemoNamesAServiceFailure
          - CreditIsNotSplitToAvoidReview
```

Reading down the `on_violation` column gives the branching that the policy
describes in prose, in a column a search can read.

**Rule 3 is named like the rest, because an unnamed rule does nothing.** It is
the one rule here that nobody in the business may approve: an order whose total
disagrees with its line items is broken rather than unusual, which is why it
says `reject`. That word buys nothing until an action names the rule. Left out
of every `guards` list it would be a rule the catalog records and no call
consults, and the strongest word in the policy would be the one with the least
effect.

Naming it makes `IssueCredit` refuse to run against an order whose books already
disagree. Catching the credit that *breaks* the agreement is a different check,
against the state the write produces, and the model cannot bind one yet. Rule 3
is the rule in this policy whose enforcement is furthest from what it says.

**Rules 4 and 5 are why the second body exists.** Neither reduces to arithmetic
over `Order` and `LineItem`, and before `judgment` they had nowhere to go but a
policy document nothing links to. Note what stays computable alongside them: the
threshold in rule 2 is arithmetic, so it remains an expression a query settles
and no model call is spent on. Folding rules 2, 4 and 5 into one paragraph of
prose, on the grounds that a model could read all three, would throw that away.

**Rule 5 is a judgment that declares `reject`.** Splitting a credit to evade
review is a rule the business means as unappealable, and no expression detects
it, so the alternative to writing it this way is leaving it out of the model.
The pairing carries a real cost, because a language model can decide two
identical credits differently and `reject` leaves nobody to appeal to. It is
published rather than forbidden, and made findable: every constraint carries a
derived `evaluation` field, which reads `judged` here, so an auditor asking
which unappealable rules a model settles gets an answer from one query.

### Two calls through that policy

A 30-dollar credit for a shipping charge billed in error, against an order
totalling 142 dollars:

```
IssueCredit(order=12345, amount=30.00,
            memo="refund of the shipping charge applied in error during the Labor Day sale")
```

Rules 1 and 3 hold: 30 is within the order, and the order's total agrees with
its line items. Rule 2 is violated, since 30 is over the self-service limit, and
its word is `escalate`. Rules 4 and 5 hold: the memo names a specific failure,
and a single credit is not a split one. One violation, so the call is held for a
supervisor, who reviews it as a credit against an order rather than as a SQL
diff.

Now three 9-dollar credits raised against the same order within the hour, each
memo reading some version of "customer asked":

```
IssueCredit(order=12345, amount=9.00, memo="customer asked")
```

Rules 1, 2 and 3 all hold — 9 is inside the order, inside the limit, and the
order's books agree — so every gate a query can compute lets this through. Rule 4 is violated and warns. Rule 5
is violated and rejects. This is the case the judged rules were added for: the
policy is being evaded precisely by staying inside the arithmetic.

When one call violates several guards, the strictest outcome applies: any
`reject` refuses the call; failing that, any `escalate` holds it; failing that,
any `warn` lets it through with the violations reported. So the first call is
held, and the second is refused with the memo warning reported alongside the
refusal.

That combination is fixed, and no part of the model states it. It is why an
action can name any number of guards without the author writing how to combine
them. It is also how `forbid` overrides `permit` in Cedar and how a deny wins in
Open Policy Agent, so a policy written this way lowers into either.

An action whose guards are *all* judged loads with a warning. Every gate then
costs a model call, none can lower to a store-level check, and each may decide
two identical calls differently. `IssueCredit` is clear of it: three of its five
guards are expressions.

**Status: nothing calls a judge.** `kcmd` parses `judgment`, validates it,
publishes it and reads it back, and publishes a derived `evaluation` field
saying whether the rule is `deterministic` or `judged` so a consumer can select
on it. No component asks a model to settle a judgment, and nothing combines
guard outcomes. The two calls above are what the published policy says should
happen, and `kcmd` publishes the fields an engine needs in order to make it
happen.

`kcmd` reports a mismatch from either side. A guard that names no constraint
fails the push. A constraint over parameters that no action names loads with a
warning, because nothing will ever evaluate it. That scan reads expressions
only: a judgment is prose, in which a word matching a parameter name is not a
read of that parameter.

**Status: nothing evaluates a guard yet.** `kcmd` parses `guards`, resolves each
name, publishes the list, and reads it back. No component checks a guard against
live data, so a guard states what must hold before the call and stops no call by
itself. What it does stop is the call running unchecked:
[`kcmd action run`](#7-run-it) refuses a guarded action outright rather than
apply a write the model says is checked first.

## 3. Say what it changes

An executor is opaque. `mcp: {server, tool}` says where the operation lives and
nothing more — no reader of the model can see what that tool writes. So the blast
radius of a call is declared or it is unknown, and `affects` is where the author
declares it:

```yaml
        affects: [Account, Transfer]
```

That is the coarse form: these concepts are touched, in a way the model does not
spell out. It is enough to answer *which actions can change an account at all*,
which is already more than an executor name answers.

A record says more — which operation, and which fields the call writes:

```yaml
        affects:
          - concept: Account
            operation: modify
            fields: [balance]
          - concept: Transfer
            operation: create
          - concept: TransferDebits
            operation: create
```

The two shapes mix freely in one list, so an author can be precise about the
concepts they know and coarse about the rest. Every `concept` — bare or named
under the key — must be something the same model declares.

### One key for both kinds

`concept` names an entity or a relationship, and the model already knows which.
Asking the author to repeat it would add a second place to get it wrong and
change nothing about what the action affects. `TransferDebits` above is the edge
from the example model; it is written exactly like the two entities beside it.

### The operations

`create`, `modify`, `delete` — the same three whatever the concept is.

An edge is not only attached and detached. A many-to-many relationship is backed
by a junction table with fields of its own, so *modify the grade on an
Enrollment* is as ordinary a change as *modify an order's total*, and a
vocabulary that gave edges only `add` and `remove` could not express it.

`fields` narrows a `create` or a `modify` to the fields the call writes, which is
what makes *which actions can change `Account.balance`* answerable. A `delete`
takes the whole instance, so naming fields beside one is rejected rather than
ignored.

Both the operation and the fields are optional. `- concept: Account` on its own
says the same thing the bare `Account` does, and is written back as the bare
form.

**Status: nothing consumes `affects` yet.** `kcmd` parses it, checks every
concept against the model, publishes it and reads it back. No component computes
an impact from it, routes on it, or checks it against what the executor actually
does.

## 4. Check it before pushing

```bash
kcmd push --validate-only
```

Four things about an action can be statically wrong once the document parses,
and each one is a hard error:

```
action 'TransferFunds' in model 'payments' (payments.yaml) has parameter
'target' whose type 'BankAccount' is neither a known entity nor a scalar
datatype.

action 'TransferFunds' in model 'payments' (payments.yaml) has an mcp executor
whose 'tool' is missing or blank.

action 'TransferFunds' in model 'payments' (payments.yaml) is guarded by
'AmountIsPostive', but model 'payments' declares no constraint of that name.

action 'TransferFunds' in model 'payments' (payments.yaml) affects 'Acount',
which is neither an entity nor a relationship this model declares.
```

A parameter type that resolves to neither an entity nor a scalar means the model
cannot say what that argument denotes, which is the whole contribution an action
makes. An executor missing a coordinate cannot be dispatched by whatever picks
the action up. A guard that names no constraint — `AmountIsPostive` here, a
misspelling of the `AmountIsPositive` declared above — leaves the author
believing the write is checked when nothing checks it. An `affects` entry naming
`Acount` describes a blast radius over a concept that does not exist, so
anything reading it reads about nothing.

The rest of an entry is checked the same way and for the same reason: fields
beside a `delete`, and a field the concept does not declare, are each a hard
error too. An operation outside `create` / `modify` / `delete` never gets this
far — the vocabulary is closed, so the document does not parse at all. All of
these checks are static, so they run on every push whatever the destination.

## 5. Push it

```bash
kcmd push
```

Knowledge Catalog is the only system an action reaches. Every other push target
deploys nothing for it and warns once:

```
Warning: [payments] 1 action(s) reach Knowledge Catalog only; the BigQuery
push deploys none of them.
```

A graph-only `kcmd push --no-kc` therefore validates the actions and then warns
that they will not be deployed.

In Knowledge Catalog, each action becomes its own entry, parented to the model
entry, the same way a metric does. The entry carries one aspect holding the
executor and the typed parameters:

```yaml
# .../entryGroups/<group>/entries/payments.actions.TransferFunds
entryType: projects/<project>/locations/global/entryTypes/semantic-action
parentEntry: .../entryGroups/<group>/entries/payments
entrySource:
  displayName: TransferFunds
  description: Move money from one account to another.
aspects:
  <project>.global.semantic-action:
    executorKind: mcp
    mcpServer: //agentregistry.googleapis.com/projects/acme-ops/locations/us-central1/mcpServers/payments
    mcpTool: transfer_funds
    parameters:
      - {name: source, type: Account, isEntityRef: true}
      - {name: target, type: Account, isEntityRef: true}
      - {name: amount, type: Float, isEntityRef: false}
    affects:
      - {concept: Account, operation: modify, fields: [balance]}
      - {concept: Transfer, operation: create}
      - {concept: TransferDebits, operation: create}
    instructions: Resolve both accounts before calling. Name the account the money leaves as `source`.
```

`affects` is published as the author wrote it and nothing more. Whether
`TransferDebits` is an entity or an edge is not stored: a consumer that needs to
know reads it off the model, which is the only thing that can say so correctly
after a rename.

Removing an action from the document deletes its entry on the next push, because
the model owns the `<model>.actions.` id prefix. A catalog search can list the
actions in a project by entry type, the way it lists entities or metrics.

`semantic-action` is a custom entry type, because Dataplex has no built-in type
for an action yet. `kcmd init --semantic-model` provisions the entry type and
its aspect type in your own project. Run init once before the first push of a
model that declares actions.

Publishing an action needs the permission to attach its aspect, in addition to
the permissions any push needs — see
[Reference → Permissions](reference.md#permissions).

## 6. Pull it back

```bash
kcmd pull
```

Pull collects the `semantic-action` entries under the model entry and rebuilds
each action, so a name, a description, an executor, typed parameters, its
`guards`, its `affects`, and `ai_context.instructions` survive the round trip
unchanged. What every part of a model does and does not survive is in
[What push and pull preserve](fidelity.md).

## 7. Run it

An action with a `sql` executor is a write `kcmd` can perform. Two commands:

```bash
kcmd action list
kcmd action run TransferFunds --arg source="Alice Checking" \
    --arg target=ACC-2 --arg amount=250
```

That second command does not succeed against the model built up on this page,
and the reason is worth knowing before the mechanics: `TransferFunds` is guarded
by `AmountIsPositive`, nothing evaluates a constraint yet, and `kcmd` refuses a
call rather than apply a write the model says must be checked first. What
follows describes an action that names no guard, which is what runs today.

`kcmd action list` is what the model declares as runnable — parameters,
executor, guards, blast radius — and each entry ends with the command line that
runs it, so reading the listing is enough to make the call:

```
Model 'payments' (payments_eg), profile 'operational':
  TransferFunds: Move money from one account to another.
    parameters: source (Account, reference), target (Account, reference), amount (Float)
    executor:   sql
    guards:     AmountIsPositive
    affects:    Account (modify), Transfer (create)
    run:        kcmd action run TransferFunds --arg source=<Account> --arg target=<Account> --arg amount=<Float>
```

### How a row is identified

An entity-typed parameter takes an object reference rather than a value, so
`--arg source="Alice Checking"` has to become one specific row before anything
can run. Two separate things decide which rows an action touches, and conflating
them is the easiest way to misread what an action does.

**Resolving an argument — one row, chosen by `kcmd`.** For each entity-typed
parameter, `kcmd` runs one lookup against that entity's table before the write:

```sql
SELECT account_id FROM account
WHERE account_id = @ref0 OR name = @ref LIMIT 2
```

The `WHERE` is built from two things the entity declares:

- **its `primary_key`.** `Account` declares `primary_key: [accountId]`, and
  `accountId` is bound to the column `account_id`, so the input is compared
  against that column. This is the answer to "how does it know which column is
  the key" — the model says so; nothing is inferred from the database. One
  argument cannot name a key of several columns, so an entity keyed that way is
  reachable only through the identifying field below.
- **an identifying text field, if the entity has one.** A `String` field that is
  not part of the key, bound to a plain column, and *named* `name`, `full_name`,
  `title`, `label` or `display_name`. `Account` declares `name`, so
  `"Alice Checking"` and the account id both find the same row. The match is on
  the field's name in the model, not the column's name in the store.

The input is compared against each column as that column's own type, so a key
declared `Integer` is only compared when the input is a number — `"Alice
Checking"` is not, so that predicate is dropped rather than cast. If nothing is
left to compare, no query is sent at all.

Exactly one row must come back. Zero is `No Account matches 'Alice Checking'.`
Two or more is ambiguous, and the candidates are listed by key so the caller can
pick one — a name is not required to be unique, and if two accounts carried this
one:

```
Error: 'Alice Checking' matches more than one Account (7, 12); use a key to
disambiguate.
```

Both are reported rather than guessed at, because both are things the caller can
act on.

**Targeting the write — however many rows the statement says.** Resolution
produces a *value*, which the statement then uses. Which rows the write lands on
is decided entirely by the statement's own `WHERE`, and `kcmd` does not
constrain it:

```sql
UPDATE account SET balance = balance - @amount WHERE account_id = @source
```

This one updates a single row because it filters on the key. A statement reading
`WHERE status = 'dormant'` would update every dormant account, and nothing would
stop it. `affects` does not limit the blast radius either — it *declares* it, so
that a reader knows what the write is about and an evaluator can one day check
the statements against what was declared. The statement is what decides.

`kcmd action run` does three things:

- **Resolve.** Each entity-typed argument becomes the one row it denotes, as
  above.
- **Bind.** Every argument becomes a query parameter of the store type its
  declared ontology type implies — a `Decimal` amount is compared as a number
  rather than as text, which is the difference between `9` being less than `10`
  and not. Nothing is interpolated into a statement.
- **Apply.** A read-write transaction is opened, the action's statements run
  inside it in order, and it commits. Any failure before the commit rolls back,
  so no partial write survives. A commit the store *refuses* wrote nothing
  either, and is reported that way — the commonest refusal is Spanner's
  `ABORTED` under lock contention, and the answer to it is to run the action
  again. What `kcmd` cannot settle for you is a commit that is neither accepted
  nor refused: a timeout or a 5xx, where the store may have applied the write
  and lost the response. That one reports the outcome as unknown rather than
  claiming a rollback, because a caller told "nothing happened" would retry a
  write that did.

Where the write goes is the model's Spanner deployment target under the selected
profile. The command line never names a database: `--profile` changes the store,
the same rule [push](profiles.md) follows.

Only a `sql` executor runs. An `mcp`, `rest` or `grpc` executor names an
operation in another system, which `kcmd` cannot call and could not roll back if
the commit failed, so it refuses rather than half-perform the write:

```
Error: Action 'TransferFunds' is executed by MCP, which runs outside this
transaction and could not be rolled back if the commit failed. Supply a handler
that performs the write as DML, or declare the action with a 'sql' executor.
```

### A guarded action is refused, not run unchecked

Nothing evaluates a constraint yet. A model that declares a rule and a runtime
that quietly ignores it is worse than no runtime, because the model states the
write is checked and nothing says otherwise — so `kcmd action run` refuses such
a call instead:

```
Error: Action 'TransferFunds' is guarded by 'AmountIsPositive', and this runtime
does not evaluate constraints yet. Running it would apply a write the model says
must be checked first, so it is refused rather than run unchecked.
```

What makes a call "such a call" is `guards`, and only `guards` — the same rule
[section 2](#2-gate-it-with-a-constraint) states, applied here. A constraint the
action does not name is a rule this call does not consult, and the runtime does
not go looking for one: a constraint that merely reads a concept the action
writes gates nothing, and neither does declaring constraints in a model whose
action leaves `affects` out. Refusing on either would mean publishing a rule
could start refusing calls that succeeded the day before, which is exactly what
making the reference explicit prevents.

A guard whose constraint declares `onViolation: warn` is the one guard that does
not refuse. Such a rule reports a violation rather than rejecting one, so an
evaluator would let the write through, and gating on it would leave a model that
states advisory rules permanently unrunnable.

Every refusal is decided before a session is opened, so a refused action leaves
no transaction behind.

## 8. Hand it to an agent

An agent needs two things from a model: a way to look at what is there, and a
way to change it. Both are already declared, so `agent_tools` reads them out
rather than inventing a tool schema.

```ts
import {modelTools} from './src/libts/semantic/agent_tools';

const {lookups, actions} = modelTools({model, client});
```

`actions` holds one write tool per action. Its name is the action's, snake-cased;
its description is the action's description followed by its
`ai_context.instructions`; its parameters are the action's parameters, with each
ontology type mapped to a JSON one and each entity-typed parameter described as
the reference it is. Invoking it runs the action — the same resolve, bind and
transact `kcmd action run` performs.

`lookups` holds one read tool per entity: exact match on any bound field,
combined with AND, capped at 50 rows. No joins, no ranges, no aggregation, no
ordering. That is enough for an agent to find the object an action needs, and it
keeps the generated SQL checkable by eye. Table and column names come from the
binding and every filter value is a bound parameter, so no caller text reaches
the SQL.

`modelTools` returns both halves with their names settled against each other. An
entity `Account` and an action `FindAccount` both want to be called
`find_account`, and deriving them together is the only place that can notice: the
action keeps the name, because it is the author's own, and the lookup takes
`lookup_account`. `actionTools` and `entityTools` are also exported for a caller
that wants one half, and each names its own tools without seeing the other.

### A tool says whether it can be called

A refusal the model alone decides is a refusal every call would meet, so it can
be decided before the tool is offered rather than inside a transaction. Both
halves carry `runnable`, and when it is false, `unavailable` says why.

For an action: a withdrawn executor, a remote executor with no handler, a guard
nothing checks, an object reference to a composite-keyed entity, or a generated
key the statement asks for that a UUID cannot fill. The verdict is asked of the
runtime rather than worked out again, so the two cannot drift — a tool
advertised as runnable that refuses every call spends the agent's turn and
teaches it nothing, and one withheld that would have worked is never discovered
at all.

For a lookup: an abstract entity, which has no table of its own; an entity no
profile bound to one; or an entity whose binding is not a plain table. The same
function answers the question here and reports it at call time, for the same
reason.

The tool is still returned and still named either way. An action the model
declares should not vanish from what the model offers; an adapter binds the
runnable ones and reports the rest.

### The framework binding is the caller's

Nothing in this module imports an agent framework. A tool is a name, a
description, typed parameters and a function, so binding one to ADK, to
LangChain or to an MCP server is a short adapter the caller writes, and a second
framework costs nothing here.

An outcome comes back as three states rather than two. A write that landed and
one that did not are the obvious pair; the third is a commit whose result
nothing can establish, reported as unknown with an explicit "do not retry",
because a caller reading it as "nothing happened" applies the write twice.

`handler` may be passed for an executor this runtime cannot perform itself. It is
not passed to an action with a `sql` executor: the claim such an action makes is
that what runs is what the catalog published, and one handler serves the whole
model, so passing it through would retract that claim for every such action at
once.

[`demo/agent`](../../demo/agent/README.md) runs all of this against a live
Spanner database — a model, a binding profile, the derived tools printed and
called by hand, and the same tools bound to a Gemini agent.

## What is not modeled yet

This is a prototype. Three things a reader reasonably expects are absent.

- **Nothing checks the write.** No component evaluates a constraint or a guard.
  A guarded action is refused rather than run, so the gap is loud where a model
  states a rule gates the call, but it is still a gap: the correctness of what a
  statement does belongs to whoever wrote it.
- **`kcmd` calls no executor but its own.** A `sql` action runs; an `mcp`,
  `rest` or `grpc` one is published for whoever dispatches it, which is why
  those three name coordinates rather than a statement.
- **The store is Spanner.** `kcmd action run` resolves, binds and transacts
  against the Spanner database the profile's deployment target names. A model
  bound to BigQuery publishes its actions and runs none of them.
