# Modeling write operations

Your semantic model already tells an agent what your data means and which
questions it can ask. Ask that agent to *do* something — refund an order, move
money between two accounts, close a dormant account — and the model has nothing
to say. The write exists somewhere, as a service call or an endpoint or a few
lines of DML, but it's visible only to whoever built the service around it. Your
agent either can't reach it, or reaches it through a hand-written tool that your
model never sees and can't govern.

An **action** closes that gap. It's a named write operation declared over the
same concepts as the rest of your model: you give it a name, type its inputs
against your ontology, and say which concepts a call changes. Publishing it puts
the operation in the same place as the data it acts on, so an agent that
discovers your model discovers what it can change there as well as what it can
ask.

One part of an action is physical — how the write actually happens. That part
lives in a field called the **executor**, which names an MCP tool, a REST
endpoint, a gRPC method, or DML. Keeping it separate lets a binding profile
supply it, so you write an action across two files. Your model names the
operation and its parameters; a binding profile names the tables, the columns,
and the executor. Whatever runs the action combines the two into one bound
model.

*Figure 1: your model and a binding profile combine into one bound model, which
both reaches your store and supplies the tools an agent is handed.*

The rest of this guide follows one action — moving money between two bank
accounts — from a name in your model through to an agent that can call it. A
second example, a customer-service credit, comes in once the rules get harder to
write.

The commands here are `kcmd`, which reads a model, pushes it, and derives the
tools an agent is handed under a binding profile. What the model states holds
for any runtime that reads it, and the library `kcmd` is built on is the same
one a service would embed.

## When to use an action

Declare an action when the write already exists. Somewhere in your organization
there's a service call, an endpoint, or some DML that moves this money or issues
this credit. Declaring it as an action doesn't reimplement any of that — it
tells everything that reads your model that the operation is there, what it
takes, and where it lives.

If the call should hand back an answer instead of changing something, you want a
[metric](README.md#1-author-the-logical-model) instead.

## 1. Declare the action

Start with the name and the parameters. They're the contract every later step
builds on, and they live in your model and nowhere else — no profile can change
them.

Actions sit at model level, beside your metrics. Each one carries a name, its
parameters, and an executor. Treat that executor as a default, because it's the
one part a binding profile can replace:

```yaml
version: "0.2.0.dev0/google"    # `actions` is a kcmd extension key
semantic_model:
  - name: payments
    entities:
      - name: Account
        description: A customer's money at this bank.
        primary_key: [accountId]
        source: my-project.bank.account
        fields:
          - { name: accountId,      datatype: Integer, expression: account_id }
          - { name: name,           datatype: String,  expression: name }
          - { name: balance,        datatype: Float,   expression: balance }
          - { name: minimumBalance, datatype: Float,   expression: minimum_balance }
          - { name: status,         datatype: String,  expression: status, description: "open, frozen or closed." }
      - name: Transfer
        description: One movement of money between two accounts.
        primary_key: [transferId]
        source: my-project.bank.transfer
        fields:
          - { name: transferId, datatype: String,  expression: transfer_id }
          - { name: amount,     datatype: Float,   expression: amount }
          - { name: debitedId,  datatype: Integer, expression: debited_account_id }
    relationships:
      - name: TransferDebits
        from: Transfer
        to: Account
        from_columns: [debitedId]
        to_columns: [accountId]
    actions:
      - name: TransferFunds
        description: Move money from one account to another.
        executor:                             # one kind only: mcp / rest / grpc / sql
          mcp:
            server: //agentregistry.googleapis.com/projects/acme-ops/locations/us-central1/mcpServers/payments
            tool: transfer_funds
        parameters:
          - name: source
            concept: Account                  # takes Account.accountId's type
            field: accountId
            description: The account the money leaves.
          - name: target
            concept: Account
            field: accountId
            description: The account the money goes to.
          - name: amount
            type: Float                       # no field carries this one
            description: How much money to move.
        ai_context:
          instructions: >-
            Resolve both accounts before calling.
    ai_context:                             # model level: true of every caller
      instructions: >-
        Never move money between two accounts held by the same customer
        without saying so in your answer.
```

You author the rest of the model — the deployment target, the entity bindings,
the relationships — the way you would for any model. See
[Deploying a semantic model](README.md).

The executor tells a consumer where the operation lives. Pick one of these four
kinds, and give any one executor a single kind only:

- **`mcp`** — `{server, tool}`. A tool you've already registered in Agent
  Registry, named by the server's resource name and the tool's name within it.
- **`rest`** — `{endpoint, method}`. An HTTP endpoint and the verb to call it
  with.
- **`grpc`** — `{service, method}`. A service and the method on it.
- **`sql`** — `{statements}`. The write itself, carried in your model instead
  of named as a pointer to whoever performs it, and the only kind kcmd runs.
  See [carrying the write as DML](#carrying-the-write-as-dml).

Both `description` and `ai_context.instructions` travel through to the catalog,
and a parameter's `description` is what tells a caller which argument is which.
Two parameters a caller could confuse must each carry one, or the push fails.
Write the instructions for the agent that's going to call the action, the way
the example does.

### Projecting a parameter from a field

Every parameter carries one scalar value — the same kind of value a column
holds. What differs is where its definition comes from, and there are two ways
to give it one: **project** it from a field of your ontology, or **declare** it
on the spot.

**A projected parameter** names a `concept` and a `field`, and takes that
field's datatype, description, label and AI context straight out of the model.
`source` above is an `Integer` because `Account.accountId` is one, so a caller
passes an account id and the write binds it as an integer. Change the field
later and every parameter projected from it follows, because there's no second
copy to keep in step. A `concept` is read the way `affects` reads one, so it can
name a relationship as well as an entity — but what you project from in practice
is an entity, because a relationship only has fields of its own when a junction
table backs it, and this format has no syntax for one yet.

Most projected parameters need no name of their own. Leave `name` out and the
parameter answers to the field's, so this one is called `accountId`:

```yaml
          - { concept: Account, field: accountId }
```

Name it yourself when one action takes the same field twice, the way
`TransferFunds` takes both a `source` and a `target`.

This shape holds however an entity is keyed. An `Account` identified by three
columns takes three projected parameters, one per key field, each typed from
the field it names — the same declaration a single-column key writes, three
times.

**A declared parameter** carries a value no field holds: the `amount` above, a
free-text memo, a reason code your store never keeps. Give it a `type` and a
description of your own. `type` takes a scalar datatype only, and naming an
entity there is an error telling you to project the field you meant.

A projected parameter can't restate its field's `type`. If the type is wrong,
fix the field. If a statement needs a different one, cast it in the DML, where
the conversion is visible to whoever reads the write instead of buried in
metadata.

Each parameter may also carry:

- **`description`** — what the parameter means for this call. A projected
  parameter inherits the field's, and overriding it is how `source` and
  `target` above say different things while projecting one field. Required when
  two parameters on the same action project the same field or share a declared
  type, because neither can tell an agent which argument is which on its own.
- **`label`** and **`ai_context`** — inherited the same way, overridden the
  same way.
- **`default`** — a fallback value substituted when the caller omits the
  argument. Giving a parameter a default makes it optional; setting
  `required: true` alongside `default` is rejected.
- **`required: false`** — marks a parameter optional with no fallback; an
  omitted call binds `NULL` in SQL.

`default` and `required` are always yours to set, projected or not. A field
says what a value *is*; the parameter says how this one call uses it.

### Where the executor comes from

Everything else your action declares is logical: what it takes, what gates it,
what it changes. None of that changes when you deploy the same model somewhere
else. The executor does, which is why it sits on the physical side with an
entity's `source`, and why a [binding profile](profiles.md) can supply one or
replace the one your model declares — for any of the four kinds. An action a
profile says nothing about keeps the executor the model gave it.

It changes for two different reasons. An `mcp`, `rest` or `grpc` executor is an
address: the operation lives at a different server, endpoint or service in
staging than it does in production, and where your rows sit never enters it. A
`sql` executor is the statement, written in the bound store's table and column
names and in its dialect, so until you know which store answers there's nothing
to write down. Only that last case turns on where the data lives.

### Actions declared but not performable

An action with no executor anywhere — none in the model, none in any profile —
is **declared but not performable**. It still says what it does, what it takes,
what gates it and what it changes; the only thing missing is who carries the
write out. Write one when nobody has wired the write up yet, or when another
team owns it and your model needs only to record that it exists.

Nothing declares this state: it follows from the executor being absent, so the
same action is performable under a profile that supplies one and not
performable under a profile that supplies none or withdraws the model's with
`executor: null`. A catalog-only push — `--no-profile`,
or a model with no deployment target — publishes it like any other action, and
`kcmd profiles` lists it under `cannot run:` for each binding that supplies no
executor for it.

## Carrying the write as DML

The first three kinds name a system that performs the write, which leaves the
write itself opaque to your model: an `mcp` tool name says where the operation
lives and nothing about what it touches. A `sql` executor carries the write
instead, so what your action does becomes readable — and checkable — from the
bound model, and the runtime can [run it](#7-hand-it-to-an-agent) rather than
handing the write to another system to perform.

Statements are written in one database's own table and column names, in its own
dialect, so a `sql` executor goes in that database's [binding
profile](profiles.md) — beside the bindings for those same tables and columns —
rather than in the model it binds. Here it replaces the `mcp` executor the model
declared for `TransferFunds`:

```yaml
# payments.profiles/operational.yaml — this store owns the rows, so it writes them
semantic_model:
  - name: payments
    deployment_target: //spanner.googleapis.com/projects/my-project/instances/my-instance/databases/bank/propertyGraphs/payments
    entities:
      - name: Account
        source: //spanner.googleapis.com/projects/my-project/instances/my-instance/databases/bank/tables/account
        fields:
          - { name: accountId, expression: account_id }
          - { name: balance,   expression: balance }
          # ... and the model's remaining entities and fields, bound the same way
    actions:
      - name: TransferFunds
        executor:
          sql:
            statements:
              - UPDATE account SET balance = balance - @amount WHERE account_id = @source
              - UPDATE account SET balance = balance + @amount WHERE account_id = @target
              - INSERT INTO transfer (transfer_id, amount, debited_account_id) VALUES (GENERATE_UUID(), @amount, @source)
```

Selecting a profile replaces the model's bindings with that profile's, so the
one you put a `sql` executor in has to carry the columns its statements name as
well — leave them out and the fields come back unbound and the action cannot
run. Of the action itself, only the executor is restated: what the call takes,
what gates it and what it changes stay in the model, exactly as
[declared](#1-declare-the-action).

`statements` is a list because one business action is often more than one write.
The transfer above debits one account, credits another, and records the
transfer row itself, and a transfer that did only the first would lose money.
kcmd opens one transaction, runs the statements in the order you wrote them,
and commits at the end, so writes that only make sense together never apply by
halves.

Carrying the write buys you two things:

- **Your blast radius is checkable.** A reader can compare `affects` against the
  statements instead of taking it on trust.
- **A guard becomes a real gate.** An MCP, REST or gRPC call commits inside a
  system kcmd doesn't control, so a write it performed can't be rolled back if
  the rest of the action fails. A `sql` action's guards settle before kcmd opens
  a transaction, and a call that doesn't clear them never reaches one, so a
  refusal leaves the store untouched.

### Statements use your database names

**An action's statements reach your store exactly as you wrote them**, so every
table and column in one has to be the name your database uses. In the `sql`
executor above, the model's `Account` and `accountId` appear as `account` and
`account_id`. Those are the table and the column that the entity's `source` key
and its fields' `expression` keys bind it to.

`@parameter` references are the exception: they name a value kcmd binds at call
time rather than anything in your database.

A statement that says `accountId` where the column is `account_id` still passes
push, because push never asks your store whether a table exists. The error comes
from the store when the action runs, and it can read like a fault in the
statement rather than a typo in a name. An entity named `Order` bound to a table
named `Orders` produces

```
Syntax error: Unexpected keyword ORDER [at 1:8]
```

instead of "no such table", because `ORDER` is a reserved word.

### Which file a `sql` executor belongs in

The placement is enforced: select a profile whose model declares a `sql`
executor and the command refuses, naming the action:

```
Error: [payments] profile 'operational': action 'TransferFunds' in model
'payments' declares a 'sql' executor. A statement names one database's own
tables and columns, so it belongs in the profile that binds them, not in the
model. Move the executor into each profile that performs this write as DML.
```

A single-file model is the exception: that one document is both the model and
its binding, so its statements already sit beside the columns they name. Add a
profile beside it later and they move into the profile.

## 2. Gate it with a constraint

The sections so far declared an action and gave it a write to perform. This
section is how you stop it running when it shouldn't. A **constraint** is a
named rule your model states over its ontology. Declaring one adds it to the
catalog and changes nothing by itself. A constraint takes effect where
something references it and nowhere else, so publishing a rule can't quietly
start refusing calls that succeeded yesterday.

```
  declared                referenced             checked            a breach
  ─────────────────       ─────────────────      ──────────────     ───────────
  constraints:            actions:               before the call,   reject
    - name: X       ──▶     - name: Y      ──▶   with the      ──▶  escalate
      judgment: …             guards: [X]        arguments bound    warn

  a rule in the           the only thing that    a language model   on_violation
  catalog, inert          gives it effect        reads the call     names one of
                                                 and settles it     the three
```

*Figure 2: a constraint moves from declared, to referenced by an action, to
checked before a call, to a breach routed by `on_violation`.*

A constraint has one body, `judgment`: the rule written as a sentence, settled
by a language model reading the attempted call.

### Naming a constraint as a guard

An action's `guards` list is what puts a constraint to work. Declare the rule,
then name it on the action — one line on the `TransferFunds` from section 1:

```yaml
    constraints:
      - name: TransferWithinAvailableBalance
        judgment: >-
          The amount argument of this call must not exceed Account.balance on
          the source account. That balance is on record rather than stated in
          the arguments, and nothing puts it in front of you.
        on_violation: reject
        description: >-
          A transfer cannot move more than the source account holds. Lower the
          amount, or choose another account.
    actions:
      - name: TransferFunds
        guards: [TransferWithinAvailableBalance]
```

`guards` holds the names of constraints your model declares, and listing one
there is what makes it apply to that action. Put the reference on the action
rather than on the constraint, because the same rule may gate `TransferFunds`
and leave `CloseAccount` alone.

That rule is the honest shape of a balance check and it is also one nothing here
enforces: the balance is a row, a judge is shown the arguments and no more, and
a rule it cannot settle it reports as not holding — which under `reject` refuses
every call. Declared this way it is a policy on record and a schema constraint
waiting to be written, not a control. Keep reading with that in mind; [a rule
the judge can't settle](#a-rule-the-judge-cant-settle) is where it is worked
through.

Whatever dispatches the call is what checks its guards, and it checks every one
of them before the call, with the arguments bound and before any transaction
opens. Nothing in your model binds a rule to the state a write leaves behind, so
a guard reports on the arguments it was handed and on the data the call starts
from, and on nothing else.

`guards` and `on_violation` are independent, the way the two right-hand columns
of figure 2 are: one says when the constraint gets checked, the other says what
a breach does. So guarding a constraint that declares `warn` is a real shape.
Your organization may not be ready to block on a rule; guarding it anyway still
gets the rule checked at the moment of the call and reported back.

When one call violates several guards, the strictest outcome applies. Any
`reject` refuses the call, failing that any `escalate` holds it, and failing
that any `warn` lets it through with the violations reported. The precedence is
fixed and nothing in your model states it, so an action can name any number of
guards without you writing down how they combine. It is also how `forbid`
overrides `permit` in Cedar and how a deny wins in Open Policy Agent, so a
policy written this way lowers into either.

A guard that names no constraint fails the push, so a typo can't leave you
believing a write is checked when nothing checks it. The reverse isn't an
error: a constraint no action names is declared, published and inert, which is
a reasonable thing to publish for a reader or for an action you haven't written
yet.

### What a judgment costs

A judgment is a whole constraint body. Here is one, with the two fields that
say what a breach does and how grave it is:

```yaml
    constraints:
      - name: CreditMemoNamesAServiceFailure
        judgment: >-
          LineItem.memo must name a specific, verifiable service failure on the
          order: a late delivery, a damaged item, a shipping charge applied in
          error. A memo that states only that the customer requested a credit
          does not satisfy this rule.
        description: >-
          Say what went wrong with the order in the credit memo.
        on_violation: warn
        severity: low
```

Settling that rule is a model call, and one goes out for every guard on every
attempted write. The verdict can also move: a ceiling of 25 dollars, stated as a
judgment, can answer two identical calls differently, where `amount <= 25` could
not.

So write a judgment for a rule that has to weigh what a caller wrote, where
nothing shorter would settle it. Two cases are worth keeping out. A threshold
over the call's own arguments is the first: `amount <= 25` needs no reading at
all, and a sentence buys you a model call and a verdict that can move.
Leave it in whatever dispatches the call — the model has no home for it today,
which is in [what is not modeled yet](#what-is-not-modeled-yet).

A rule that turns on a stored value is the second. Nothing fetches that value
for the judge, so the sentence gets settled against a figure the model supplied
itself or refused for want of one. Write the rule down anyway if the model is
where your policy lives, and enforce it in your schema — see
[a rule the judge can't settle](#a-rule-the-judge-cant-settle) for what you get
if you don't.

Every constraint must state `on_violation`, and any of the three words will do.
Omit it and the push fails, because an unmarked constraint would reject, and
that's too strong a consequence to inherit by silence.

### What a guard can see

A guard is checked before the call, with the arguments bound and before any
transaction opens. It sees one thing: the arguments it was handed. A rule about
the arguments — whether the memo the caller wrote names a real service failure,
say — is settled completely, because the arguments are the whole of what it
reads.

Nothing settles a rule about a stored value the call doesn't carry. A judge is
given the rule, the action and the arguments, and goes nowhere for anything
else, so *the credit must not exceed the total of the order* has no total to
compare against — see
[a rule the judge can't settle](#a-rule-the-judge-cant-settle). Put that rule in
your schema, where the store enforces it inside the transaction.

Nothing settles a rule about the state a write *leaves behind*, either. "An
order's total equals the sum of its lines" has nothing to look at when the guard
runs, for a second reason: the state it describes does not exist yet. That one
belongs in the same place.

**Status: `judgment` is the only body a constraint has.** Whatever checks a
guard puts the sentence to a language model and routes the verdict by
`on_violation`.

### Writing a judgment

A language model reads your sentence at review time with the proposed write in
front of it. That reader is the judge. Five habits make that reading
consistent:

1. **State what must be true of the data.** Write the condition — *the memo
   must name a specific service failure*, and not the procedure, *check whether
   the memo is specific*. Your sentence describes a clean write, and everything
   about handling a breach lives elsewhere.
2. **Name fields model-qualified.** Write `LineItem.memo` rather than "the
   memo". A push resolves every `Entity.field` token in the text against your
   model and fails when the entity declares no such field, so a rename can't
   leave your sentence pointing at nothing. It also tells a reader which value
   the rule is about, which the judge cannot go and fetch.
3. **Say what doesn't count.** A rule with no negative example gets graded
   against whatever the model guesses you had in mind. The sentence "A memo
   that states only that the customer requested a credit does not satisfy this
   rule" buys you more consistency than any further description of what a good
   memo is.
4. **Leave the consequence out of the prose.** What happens on a breach is
   `on_violation`. A judgment ending "…otherwise escalate to a supervisor"
   states a routing nothing reads, and the engine routes by the field
   regardless.
5. **Keep it to one condition.** When your sentence needs "and also", the
   second half is a second constraint. One `on_violation` can't carry two
   consequences, so two conditions that end differently can't share a
   constraint.

All five are about wording. Claim no more in the wording than a judge can
settle.

A judge settles a guard from the call's arguments and nothing else, so a
sentence about stored data is a rule it has no evidence for. The instructions
tell it to refuse in that case and say what's missing, but that instruction
binds a model rather than the runtime, so the rule can come back held instead —
a guard that never fires and never says why. Phrase the condition around the
arguments the call carries, and try every guard against a case it ought to
refuse.

A rule that does need a stored row — comparing a credit against the order total,
say — has no binding point here at all. Put it in your schema, where the store
enforces it inside the transaction. See
[a rule the judge can't settle](#a-rule-the-judge-cant-settle).

## A credit policy, worked through

Real policies have several rules, and the rules rarely end the same way. A
support agent is about to issue a customer-service credit, and five separate
rules bear on whether they may:

```
  the business rule                        a breach   settled
  ──────────────────────────────────────   ────────   ────────────────────────
  1  no credit above the order's total     escalate   judgment, reading a row
  3  the memo names a service failure      warn       judgment
  4  not one credit split to evade review  reject     judgment
  ──────────────────────────────────────   ────────   ────────────────────────
  2  over 25 dollars needs a supervisor    —          your dispatch, not here
  5  the total equals the line items       —          your schema, not here
```

*Table 1: the three rules of the credit policy that a guard can carry, what a
breach of each one does, and the two rules that belong somewhere else.*

Rules 2 and 5 are in the table to be ruled out. Rule 5 is about the state a
write leaves behind, and a guard runs before the transaction opens, so no
constraint you write here reaches it; put it in your schema. Rule 2 compares one
argument against a literal: written as a judgment it would buy a model call to
perform a subtraction, and a verdict that can move at the boundary. Leave it in
whatever dispatches the call. The 25-dollar ceiling still governs the desk, and
rule 4 is written against it, but nothing in the model states it.

Writing the other three down needs an `Order` with a `total`, a `LineItem` with
an `amount` and a `memo`, and an `IssueCredit` action taking the order, the
amount and the memo. Each rule becomes one constraint, and each states its own
outcome in `on_violation`:

```yaml
    constraints:
      - name: CreditWithinOrderTotal              # rule 1
        judgment: >-
          The amount argument of this call must not exceed the total of the
          Order it is applied to. That total is on record rather than stated in
          the arguments, and nothing puts it in front of you. Read both as
          dollars.
        description: >-
          A credit cannot exceed the total of the order it credits. Lower the
          amount, or split it across the orders it actually covers.
        on_violation: escalate
        severity: high

      - name: CreditMemoNamesAServiceFailure      # rule 3
        judgment: >-
          LineItem.memo must name a specific, verifiable service failure on the
          order: a late delivery, a damaged item, a shipping charge applied in
          error. A memo that states only that the customer requested a credit
          does not satisfy this rule.
        description: >-
          Say what went wrong with the order in the credit memo.
        on_violation: warn
        severity: low

      - name: CreditIsNotSplitToAvoidReview       # rule 4
        judgment: >-
          A credit must not appear to be one larger credit divided into parts
          that each stay under the 25-dollar self-service limit. Read the
          proposed amount together with the other credits already on the same
          Order: several near-limit credits raised close together for related
          reasons are one credit, whatever each memo says on its own.
        description: >-
          Raise this as a single credit for the full amount and send it for
          supervisor review.
        on_violation: reject
        severity: critical

    actions:
      - name: IssueCredit
        executor:
          mcp:
            server: //agentregistry.googleapis.com/projects/acme-ops/locations/us-central1/mcpServers/commerce
            tool: issue_credit
        parameters:
          - { name: order,  concept: Order, field: orderId }
          - { name: amount, type: Decimal }
          - { name: memo,   type: String }
        guards:
          - CreditWithinOrderTotal
          - CreditMemoNamesAServiceFailure
          - CreditIsNotSplitToAvoidReview
```

Each `on_violation` key carries one branch of what your policy describes in
prose, in a form a search can read.

**Rules 3 and 4 are the reason a constraint is written in words.** Neither
reduces to arithmetic over `Order` and `LineItem` at all, so there's nowhere
else to put them but a policy document nothing links to.

**Rule 1 is arithmetic against a row, and nothing here settles it.** It compares
the amount argument against a number that lives in the database, and a judge
sees the arguments only, so the rule is recorded in the model and enforced in
your schema — see
[a rule the judge can't settle](#a-rule-the-judge-cant-settle). Rule 2 is the
same comparison against a literal rather than a row, and that difference is the
whole reason it stays out of the model. Rule 4 reads on the credits already
sitting on the order, so it is the same case as rule 1.

**Rule 4 is a judgment that declares `reject`.** Splitting a credit to evade
review is a rule the business means as unappealable, and the pairing carries a
real cost, because a model can decide two identical credits differently and
`reject` leaves nobody to appeal to. The model publishes such a rule instead of
forbidding it, and makes it findable: an auditor asking which unappealable rules
your model settles gets an answer from one query over the constraints.

### Two calls through the policy

Here are two calls against order 12345, which totals $165.85. One is a
200-dollar credit for a shipping charge billed in error, which is more than the
order was ever worth. The other is three 9-dollar credits raised within the
hour, each memo reading some version of "customer asked":

```
                                  amount=200.00,         amount=9.00 x3,
                                  "shipping charge       "customer asked"
                                   applied in error"
  ──────────────────────────────  ─────────────────────  ─────────────────────
  1  within the order's total     violated ─▶ escalate   holds
  3  memo names a failure         holds                  violated ─▶ warn
  4  not split to evade review    holds                  violated ─▶ reject
  ──────────────────────────────  ─────────────────────  ─────────────────────
  strictest outcome wins          held for a supervisor  refused, with the
                                                         memo warning reported
```

*Table 2: how each of the two calls fares against the three rules, and the
outcome that wins.*

The supervisor who gets the first call reviews a credit against an order rather
than a SQL diff. The second call is the case rule 4 was written for. Every
per-call gate lets it through, because each 9-dollar credit sits under the
order's total on its own, and under the desk's 25-dollar ceiling too, and only
reading the three together as one 27-dollar credit puts them over it.

The bottom row of table 2 applies the strictest-outcome rule from section 2 —
an `escalate` with nothing stricter beside it holds the first call, and rule 4's
`reject` decides the second.

**Status: a run doesn't compute the strictest outcome.** The runtime puts the
guards to the judge in the order your model declares them and stops at the
first one that fails without being advisory. What comes back is that guard's
outcome rather than the strictest of them, and a `warn` collected on the way
there doesn't travel with the refusal.

## 3. Say what it changes

`affects` names the concepts a call writes to. An executor like
`mcp: {server, tool}` says where the operation lives and nothing more, so no
reader of your model can see what that tool writes; the blast radius of a call
stays unknown until you declare it here.

`affects` is a list, and every entry in it takes one of two shapes: a bare
concept name, or a record that also says how the concept changes.

**A bare name** says the concept is touched, in a way your model doesn't spell
out:

```yaml
        affects: [Account, Transfer]
```

That's enough to answer *which actions can change an account at all*, which is
already more than an executor name answers.

**A record** adds the operation and the fields the call writes:

```yaml
        affects:
          - concept: Account
            operation: modify
            fields: [balance]
          - concept: Transfer
            operation: create
          - concept: TransferDebits
            operation: create
```

You'll usually have worked some concepts out further than others. The two
shapes go in one list together, so a coarse entry on the ones you haven't costs
you nothing on the ones you have:

```yaml
        affects:
          - { concept: Account, operation: modify, fields: [balance] }
          - Transfer
```

`affects` declares the blast radius rather than limiting it. Naming one field
doesn't stop a statement from writing others, and naming two concepts doesn't
stop a call from touching a third; the list records what you mean the call to
do.

### What an entry may say

`concept` takes an entity or a relationship, written the same way for either
kind — your model already records which one it is. `TransferDebits` above is
the edge from the example model, and it sits in the list beside the two
entities. Either way the name has to be one the same model declares.

`operation` is `create`, `modify` or `delete`, the same three whatever the
concept is, and a fourth word means your document doesn't parse. Leaving it out
gives you the coarse form one entry at a time, covering every operation on that
concept. Two entries on one concept with the same operation are a hard load
error, and a bare entry beside one with an operation warns, because the bare
one already covered what the second narrows.

`fields` names what a `create` or a `modify` writes, which makes *which actions
can change `Account.balance`* answerable. A `delete` takes the whole instance,
so a field named beside one is rejected rather than ignored.

On a relationship, `fields` means the junction table's own columns, so *modify
the grade on an Enrollment* is as ordinary a change as *modify an order's
total*. A plain foreign-key edge carries no columns of its own, and
`TransferDebits` is one, so naming a field on it is an error — the property you
meant belongs to an endpoint entity.

Name the concept now and refine it later. Writing `- concept: Account` on its
own says the same thing the bare `Account` does, and it's written back as the
bare form.

**Status: nothing compares `affects` to what your executor does.** kcmd parses
it, checks the concepts against your ontology, publishes it and reads it back,
and no component reconciles the declaration with the statements or the tool
call. Two things beyond those checks read it. Resolving your model through a
binding profile drops any action affecting a concept the profile can't bind, so
that action never reaches the catalog. Publishing an action whose affected
concept has no entry in the same push warns you that the catalog now records a
blast radius naming something it can't resolve.

## 4. Check it before pushing

`kcmd push --validate-only` runs the checks a push runs and deploys nothing. It
loads your model, checks each action against the ontology that same model
declares, and prints every error it finds. A push clears the same gate before
it writes anything, so whatever this reports would have stopped your deploy:

```bash
kcmd push --validate-only
```

Once your document parses, five checks run over every action, and a failure in
any of them stops the push:

- **Every parameter has a type the model can settle** — projected from a field,
  or a scalar datatype you named. A `concept` the model doesn't declare, a
  `field` that concept doesn't have, a `type` sitting on a projected parameter,
  and a `type` naming an entity are four different mistakes and report as four
  different errors.
- **Parameters a caller could confuse each carry a `description`.** Two
  parameters projecting `Account.accountId`, or two sharing a declared type,
  otherwise produce identical tool argument documentation, leaving an agent
  guessing which is `source` and which is `target`.
- **The executor has the fields its kind requires.** `server` and `tool` for
  `mcp`, `endpoint` and `method` for `rest`, `service` and `method` for `grpc`,
  at least one statement for `sql`. Leave one blank and whatever picks the
  action up has nothing to call.
- **Every name in `guards` is a constraint the model declares.** This is the
  one that costs you silently — a guard naming a constraint that doesn't exist
  gates nothing, so you believe the write is checked while nothing checks it.
- **Every `affects` concept is an entity or relationship the model declares.**
  The list exists to answer *which actions change `Account`*. A typo is
  invisible on the page and would drop the action out of that answer.

A model that breaks all five reports all five, one line each, and deploys
nothing:

```
Error: action 'TransferFunds' in model 'payments' (payments) has parameter
'amount' typed 'Currency', which is not a scalar datatype
(String/Integer/Decimal/Float/Boolean/Date/Time/DateTime/DateTimeTz/Opaque).
Error: action 'TransferFunds' in model 'payments' (payments) has multiple
parameters projected from 'Account.accountId', so parameters 'source' and
'target' must each have a 'description' of their own to distinguish them.
Error: action 'TransferFunds' in model 'payments' (payments) has an mcp
executor whose 'tool' is missing or blank.
Error: action 'TransferFunds' in model 'payments' (payments) is guarded by
'TransferWithinAvailableBalence', but model 'payments' declares no constraint
of that name.
Error: action 'TransferFunds' in model 'payments' (payments) affects 'Acount',
which is neither an entity nor a relationship this model declares.
```

`TransferWithinAvailableBalence` there misspells the
`TransferWithinAvailableBalance` the model declares, and `Acount` misspells
`Account` — the two typos a reader of the document would skim straight past.

kcmd checks the rest of an `affects` entry just as strictly. Fields beside a
`delete` are a hard error, and so is a field the concept doesn't declare. An
operation outside `create` / `modify` / `delete` never gets this far — the
vocabulary is closed, so your document doesn't parse at all.

The two checks that read your ontology stand down when a binding profile
resolves your model. Resolving drops entities and relationships the profile
can't bind, so holding `affects` to the ontology there would fail your deploy
over a concept the profile removed rather than one you mistyped. An undeclared
concept and an undeclared field fall back to the warning the loader already
gave. A catalog-only push reads the author's model whole, so it treats the same
two as hard errors. Fields beside a `delete` read only the entry, so that one
fails everywhere.

### What push holds a statement to

kcmd checks a `sql` executor further than the other three kinds, because it
carries the write rather than a pointer to whoever performs it:

- Write each statement as a **single `INSERT`, `UPDATE` or `DELETE`**. A
  statement that reads is a query and belongs in a metric; one that reshapes the
  schema isn't an action. A `;` anywhere but the end is rejected, because each
  list entry runs on its own and anything after the separator would silently not
  run.
- **Every `@name` a statement binds has to resolve** to a parameter your
  action declares. Anything you write another way is left alone — a literal
  passes, and so does a SQL function. Nothing is interpolated into the
  statement text, so an argument can't become SQL.
- **You choose where a new row's key comes from.** Write `GENERATE_UUID()`
  into the `VALUES` list, pass the key in as an ordinary parameter, or, where
  the key column has a default, leave it out and let the store fill it. kcmd
  generates nothing on your behalf, and nothing in `affects` bears on the
  choice.
- **A key that arrives as an argument is a key the caller chooses.** An agent
  filling that parameter can name a row that already exists, and nothing in
  kcmd stops it, because the check on statement shape reads only the first
  word. An upsert therefore passes and overwrites. Spanner spells one
  `INSERT OR UPDATE` and AlloyDB spells one `INSERT ... ON CONFLICT`. A plain
  `INSERT` fails on the duplicate instead. Generate the key inside the
  statement unless something about the call needs the caller to pick it.
- Nothing else is available: no control flow, and no statement composed at call
  time. `statements` is a fixed list in your model, so an action whose body
  arrived with the call would declare nothing, and a gate can't check what was
  never declared.

## 5. Push it

```bash
kcmd push
```

Knowledge Catalog is the one system your action reaches. Each action becomes its
own entry there, parented to the model entry, the same way a metric does. The
entry carries one aspect holding the executor and the typed parameters:

```yaml
# .../entryGroups/<group>/entries/payments.actions.TransferFunds
entryType: projects/<project>/locations/global/entryTypes/semantic-action
parentEntry: .../entryGroups/<group>/entries/payments
entrySource:
  displayName: TransferFunds
  description: Move money from one account to another.
aspects:
  <project>.global.semantic-action:
    executorKind: mcp
    mcpServer: //agentregistry.googleapis.com/projects/acme-ops/locations/us-central1/mcpServers/payments
    mcpTool: transfer_funds
    parameters:
      - {name: source, type: Integer, concept: Account, field: accountId, description: The account the money leaves.}
      - {name: target, type: Integer, concept: Account, field: accountId, description: The account the money goes to.}
      - {name: amount, type: Float}
    affects:
      - {concept: Account, operation: modify, fields: [balance]}
      - {concept: Transfer, operation: create}
      - {concept: TransferDebits, operation: create}
    instructions: Resolve both accounts before calling.
```

A projected parameter publishes both halves: the `concept` and `field` it came
from, and the `type` that projection settled on. The reference is what you
wrote and what a pull reads back, so the link into your ontology survives the
round trip. The resolved type is there for a consumer reading the catalog
without your model in hand, which would otherwise have no way to know what to
pass.

`affects` is published exactly as you wrote it. The entry doesn't record
whether `TransferDebits` is an entity or an edge. A consumer that needs that
answer reads it off your model, the only place that still answers correctly
after a rename.

Every action in your model gets an entry, whether or not the binding you pushed
can perform it. When that binding gives an action no executor, the entry
publishes without the executor fields, so the catalog records an action that
nothing is yet wired up to run. A push reads the binding named by `--profile`,
or by `default_profile` in `catalog.yaml` when you don't name one.

Remove an action from your document and the next push deletes its entry, because
your model owns the `<model>.actions.` id prefix. A catalog search can list the
actions in a project by entry type, the way it lists entities or metrics.

`semantic-action` is a custom entry type, because Dataplex has no built-in type
for an action yet. Run `kcmd init --semantic-model` once before you push a model
that declares actions, and it provisions the entry type and its aspect type in
your own project.

Publishing an action needs the permission to attach its aspect, on top of the
permissions any push needs — see
[Reference → Permissions](reference.md#permissions).

## 6. Pull it back

```bash
kcmd pull
```

Pull collects the `semantic-action` entries under your model entry and rebuilds
each action. The name, the description, the executor, the typed parameters,
`guards`, `affects`, and `ai_context.instructions` all survive the round trip
unchanged. [What push and pull preserve](fidelity.md) lists which parts of a
model survive that trip and which don't.

## 7. Hand it to an agent

You don't write the tools an agent calls. You point an agent at your model, and
what it can change and what gates the change are derived from the model.

The **derivation** is the step that turns a bound model into the set an agent is
handed. The library runs it, and `kcmd` calls the library, so a service that
embeds the library hands its agents the same set. It produces a **write
tool** for every action and one **instruction** from your model's `ai_context`.

Nothing else in your model becomes a tool of its own. A constraint reaches an
agent only through an action that guards on it. Entities, relationships and
metrics get no tool here, so an agent reads or totals through its own read
surface and calls these tools to change the store.

### The set an agent is handed

`kcmd agent-tools` prints every tool the derivation produces, with the
instruction they arrive with. It reads your model under the profile you name and
needs the store that profile binds, because what an agent can call depends on
it. The command opens no connection and runs nothing:

```bash
kcmd agent-tools
```

For the model built up on this page, that set is:

```
Model 'payments' (payments_eg), profile 'operational':
  store: my-project/my-instance/semantic_skill_demo

  action  transfer_funds  (TransferFunds)
      Move money from one account to another.

      Resolve both accounts before calling.

      This call is gated by TransferWithinAvailableBalance:
      - TransferWithinAvailableBalance: The amount argument of this call must
        not exceed Account.balance on the source account. That balance is on
        record rather than stated in the arguments, so read it before
        answering. A transfer cannot move more than the source account holds.
        Lower the amount, or choose another account.
      source: integer -- The account the money leaves.
      target: integer -- The account the money goes to.
      amount: number -- How much money to move.

  instruction:
      Never move money between two accounts held by the same customer without
      saying so in your answer.

      Never invent an identifier. When you are given a name or a description
      where an action wants a key, ask the caller or read the store directly.
      When a tool reports that a write did not happen, read the reason it gives
      and repeat it plainly; if it says a person has to decide, say so and
      stop, because you cannot approve it yourself. When a write did happen and
      the tool returns warnings, the change landed and a rule still went unmet
      or unchecked: report both, because nobody else will. Finish by saying
      what you changed.
```

`transfer_funds` is offered, guard and all. The rule it is gated by is in the
tool's own description, wording and all, so the agent argues its call against
the rule before making it rather than learning it from a refusal.

A guard is not a reason to withhold a tool here. Who settles a rule belongs to
whoever dispatches the call, and this listing cannot know what that will be, so
marking the action unrunnable would describe a caller rather than your model.
What does get marked `[NOT RUNNABLE]` is what supplying a judge would not
repair: no executor under this binding, an executor this runtime holds no
handler for, a guard naming a rule your model never declares, or a guard naming
one that states no rule to put to a judge. Such a tool is **withheld**, and the
listing keeps it, printed named
and described, with what it's waiting on underneath, because an action your
model declares shouldn't vanish from the set your model offers.

Nothing in the listing was written for a particular agent. It reads the same
whether your caller is ADK, LangChain, or a person deciding whether the model
says enough yet.

### Where each line comes from

Most of the listing traces back to a key in your model or your profile, one
line of output per key:

```

  actions[].executor               ───▶  what the write tool runs
```

*Table 3: which key in your model or your profile produces each line of the
agent listing.*

Two things come from neither file. The derivation appends a paragraph to the
instruction, its own text about using the tools, identical for every model. And
where a call could not succeed, the runtime adds `[NOT RUNNABLE]` and the
paragraph under it saying what stands in the way — absent above, because this
call can.

The instruction at the foot of the listing has two parts, because two different
people own them.

One part is your model's own `ai_context.instructions` — what this business asks
of anything that acts on it, including the agents nobody has written yet. It
belongs to the model because an agent carrying the same rule in its own source
is a place someone can change that rule without the people who own the model
finding out. Agents get replaced when frameworks change; your model doesn't.

The other part is about the tools rather than the business: what a refused write
or a warning means. The derivation owes that part, because it describes a
contract this module defines and your model never stated. Write it into each
agent instead and you copy the same paragraph into every adapter, where it
drifts in each one.

So an agent that appends a persona of its own is saying something your model did
not. Put it in the model.

### What a write tool does

A **write tool** runs the action. Calling `transfer_funds` puts every guard the
action names to whatever judge the runtime behind it holds, binds every argument
as a typed query parameter, and applies the action's statements in one
transaction against the store your profile's deployment target names.

Nothing is interpolated into a statement: the argument's ontology type — the
field's, where the parameter projects one — decides the store type that
parameter takes. Any failure before the commit rolls back, so no partial write
survives, and an `UPDATE` or `DELETE` that matches no rows is one of those
failures (`INSERT` is the one exemption, because it creates rows rather than
finding them). A run ends applied, refused with nothing written, or unknown — a
timeout or a 5xx where your store may have applied the write and lost the
response, which is reported as unknown rather than as a rollback so a caller
does not retry and apply the write twice.

### What a withheld tool is waiting on

A **write tool** is withheld for one of four reasons:

- This binding supplies no executor, because the model declared none or a
  profile withdrew it with `executor: null`.
- The executor is `mcp`, `rest` or `grpc`, and the caller supplied no handler
  to perform the write.
- It names a guard this runtime cannot settle — a judgment with no judge to
  ask, or one with no words in it.
- The runtime has no store, because a call needs somewhere to land.

How an entity is keyed is not among them. Every parameter is a scalar, so an
action taking the three key fields of a three-part key is as callable as one
taking a single id.

The derivation asks the runtime for every one of these verdicts instead of
working them out again, so the two can't drift: a tool advertised as runnable
that refuses each call spends your agent's turn, and one withheld that would
have worked is never tried. (`kcmd agent-tools` on the command line lists a
guarded action as runnable even so, because a command-line listing describes
the model rather than a particular caller's judge; `modelTools({runtime})` in
code checks the `judge` on the runtime you hand in.)

### When a rule stops the call

Calling a write tool puts every rule the action names to the runtime behind it,
and the outcomes below are what it does with the answers.

Only a constraint the action names in `guards` has a say in a call, which is
[section 2](#2-gate-it-with-a-constraint)'s rule reaching the runtime. A
constraint your model declares and your action doesn't name has no bearing on
the write, and nothing goes looking for one.

A guard is a sentence, and settling a sentence needs something that reads one.
A runtime given nothing to read with withholds the tool up front, and refuses a
call that a non-advisory guard covers rather than running the write unchecked:

```
Error: Action 'TransferFunds' is guarded by 'TransferWithinAvailableBalance',
which is settled by reading the call, and this runtime was given no judge to
ask. Running it would apply a write the model says must be checked first, so it
is refused rather than run unchecked.
```

An advisory rule is one declaring `on_violation: warn`. It reports a violation
instead of rejecting one, so gating on it would permanently block every run of a
model that states advisory rules. An advisory guard stands down instead: the run
carries on, and a warning line records that nothing checked the rule.

A refusal is settled before a session opens, so a refused action leaves no
transaction behind. A guard whose `judgment` has no words in it is refused the
same way, before any judge is asked, because there is nothing to ask about.

### When the rule is a sentence

A guard stated as a `judgment` needs something that can read a sentence, and
whatever dispatches the call has to be holding one. In the runtime shipped here
that is Gemini on Vertex AI, hired by the application that embeds the runtime
and handed to it once, at construction:

```ts
const judge = new GeminiJudge(ctx, {model: 'gemini-2.5-flash'});
```

Each rule's own sentence goes to the model with the attempted call. A verdict
comes back with a reason, and `on_violation` decides what follows. With
`reject` the call stops before a transaction opens. `escalate` stops it too and
adds one sentence: "The model marks this rule 'escalate', so an approver may
allow it; nothing here can." `warn` lets the write through and reports the
verdict alongside the commit.

Four things are in a refusal and kcmd wrote none of them: the constraint's name,
your own sentence, the judge's reason, and the constraint's `description`, which
is the line telling the caller what to do instead.

**The rule is settled before the transaction opens.** A model call takes
seconds, and holding write locks across one costs more than it buys, so the
judge is asked first and the transaction opens only if the answer allows it. So
no verdict is reached against the state the write produces, and none is reached
under the transaction's locks either: two calls racing each other are judged
independently, and a rule that only holds when they are serialised holds for
neither. A rule about the state a write leaves, or one that has to hold under
concurrency, belongs in your schema, where the store enforces it inside the
transaction.

**The judge gets the attempted call.** It receives the rule's text, the action's
name and description, and the arguments as the caller stated them —
`order=12347`, the value itself, and not the `Order` row it identifies. That's
the whole of what it has.

**A rule that never reached a judge is reported as unchecked.** You supplied no
judge, or the model call failed. Either way the run learns nothing about the
rule, and `on_violation` routes that like any other breach. An advisory guard
lets the write through and warns, naming the rule and saying it was not checked.
A guard declaring `reject` or `escalate` stops the call. The warning is there
because committing in silence would tell you every rule passed when one was
never put to anybody.

### A rule the judge can't settle

Some rules aren't about the call. *The credit must not exceed the total of the
order it is applied to* compares an argument against a number in your database,
and the caller is under no obligation to state it correctly. Nothing here goes
and gets that number. A judge is handed the rule, the action and the arguments,
and that is the whole of what it is shown.

Write such a rule as a `judgment` anyway and what you get is a guess. Asked
whether a $3.00 credit fits under order 12346's total, the judge has no total:
it either reports that it can't tell — which `reject` and `escalate` turn into a
refused call that was fine — or it answers against a figure it supplied itself.
You don't get to choose which. So the judge is instructed to treat a rule it
can't settle from the arguments as one that does not hold, and to say in its
reason what was missing. That is the safe failure, not a working check.

A rule like that belongs in your schema, where the store enforces it inside the
transaction — the same place a rule about the state a write leaves belongs, for
the reason given just above. `CreditWithinOrderTotal` and `CreditIsNotSplitToAvoidReview` in the
worked example are both this kind: the first names a total that is on record,
the second the credits already sitting on the order. They are written down here
because the model is where the policy is recorded, and a rule nothing settles is
still a rule an agent reading the action is told about. What no judge will do is
enforce them.

### Which rows a call touches

Two things decide which rows a call touches, and they run at different moments:
you pass a value, and the statement's own `WHERE` clause picks the rows that
value lands on.

**Passing a value.** An argument names a value rather than a row. Passing
`source: 7` to `transfer_funds` doesn't mean *the account whose id is 7*; it
means the number 7, bound to `@source` wherever the statement puts it, as the
type `Account.accountId` declares.

So a caller holding a name rather than an id has to turn one into the other
first, by reading the store or asking for the key before the call. That's
deliberate: finding the right row can be a search with several plausible
answers, and the place to settle which one is in front of whoever is asking —
not inside a write transaction, which would have to pick one silently and commit
to it.

**Targeting the write.** Your statement's `WHERE` clause decides how many rows
it lands on, and nothing would stop one that hits every dormant account. That is
what [section 3](#3-say-what-it-changes) means by `affects` declaring the blast
radius rather than limiting it.

The runtime checks one thing here: that an `UPDATE` or a `DELETE` matched
something. Zero rows fails the run and rolls the transaction back, which catches
an argument naming a row that isn't there. It can't catch an argument put in the
wrong place — `WHERE region = @source` will match some row, and that row is the
one your write lands on.

### Calling it from code

`kcmd agent-tools` prints these tools; `modelTools` returns them. Both take a
**semantic runtime**: one model paired with the store your profile binds it to.
`createSemanticRuntimes` assembles them the way `kcmd agent-tools` does, so your
agent reads the model the CLI reads, under the same profile, with the same merge
and the same warnings:

```ts
import {createSemanticRuntimes} from './src/libts/semantic/runtime/runtime';
import {modelTools, callableTools} from './src/libts/semantic/runtime/agent_tools';

const runtimes = await createSemanticRuntimes({profile: 'operational'});
if ('error' in runtimes) throw new Error(runtimes.error);

const runtime = runtimes[0];
if (!runtime.store) throw new Error(runtime.storeError);

const {callable, withheld, instruction} = callableTools(modelTools({runtime}));
```

`modelTools` returns `{actions, instruction}` — the two things the listing
printed. `callableTools` then sorts the actions into the ones this binding can
serve and the ones it can't, which is a split every adapter has to make and the
same split every time. Each tool carries a `runnable` flag, and `unavailable`
carries the reason. Offer `callable` to your agent, and report `withheld`
instead of hiding it.

Each tool is a name, a description, typed parameters and `invoke(args)`, so
binding one to ADK, to LangChain or to an MCP server is a short adapter over
that shape, and a second framework costs you nothing here. Nothing in this
module imports an agent framework.

`invoke` answers with three states: the write landed, the write didn't happen,
or the statements ran and the commit gave no answer either way. That last one
comes back as `unknown` alongside an explicit instruction not to retry, because
a caller reading it as "nothing happened" applies the write twice. A write that
landed carries `committedAt`; one that didn't carries `reason` and `whatToDo`.
Only a write that landed carries `warnings`, so dropping them tells your agent a
write met every rule the model states when it didn't.

`modelTools` also takes `judge`, and an action guarded by a judgment is callable
only when you pass one. `GeminiJudge` implements the seam over Vertex AI, and so
does anything carrying a name and a `decide` method. Omit it and such an action
is still derived and reported in `withheld`. The judge goes to the derivation
rather than to each call because one object has to answer `runnable` and answer
the call: a tool derived with a judge and then invoked without one would be
advertised as callable and refused mid-call.

Pass `handler` for an executor this runtime can't perform itself. An action with
a `sql` executor never receives it. Such an action promises that the catalog
published the statements it runs, and one handler serves the whole model, so
handing it through would break that promise for every `sql` action at once.

One call to `createSemanticRuntimes` returns a runtime for every model document
in your entry group. Each runtime carries the store that its deployment target
names, the profile it was built under, and the document it was authored in, so a
message about one model can say which file and which profile produced it.

`runtime.store.kind` is `'spanner'`, `'alloydb'` or `'bigquery'`, and only a
Spanner or AlloyDB store takes a write. Ask a BigQuery-backed runtime for a
client and you get an error naming the dataset instead, because an action's
statements need an operational database. A model whose profile binds no store at
all still gets a runtime, with `storeError` saying why. Its tools are still
derived, each marked unavailable for that reason, so your agent is told what the
model offers and why it can't reach it.

### The commerce demo, worked through

`demo/semantic-model/skill/` runs this against a live operational store, with no
agent code at all: a commerce model, a binding profile, and an
[Agent Skill](https://agentskills.io) generated from the pair by `kcmd
skills-generate`. The skill is a folder of Markdown — a router naming the
action, and a reference page carrying its arguments, its four rules verbatim and
what it changes. Installed into a coding agent and handed a support request in
English, that agent finds the order and attempts the write. Its README walks the
steps and reaches all three of `on_violation`'s outcomes against that store: a
$30 credit held because the model's $25 self-service ceiling is `escalate`, a
credit written with a warning because the memo names no service failure, and a
credit refused outright because the memo admits it's one piece of a larger
amount.

None of those three outcomes was decided by the agent reading the skill. The
ceiling, the memo rule and the split-credit rule came out of the model, and the
runtime settled each one on the way through the call — so an agent that ignores
what the skill says about them still cannot get past them. Regenerate against a
different model and profile and the skill describes a different business;
nothing is hand-written, so there is nothing to keep in step.

The README also states what that costs and what it can't do. The model guards on
four judgments, so every guard on every call is a model call. That is most of
the latency in the runs it captures. Three of its rules fall short of what they
say:

- **An order's total matching its line items is declared and not enforced.**
  It's a statement about the state the write leaves behind, and guards settle
  before the write.
- **The credit-within-total rule is declared and not enforced.** The total is a
  row, and a judge sees the arguments — see
  [a rule the judge can't settle](#a-rule-the-judge-cant-settle). Its
  transcripts were recorded when a judge could read; nothing settles it now.
- **The split-credit rule catches only a disclosed split.** It fires because
  the model tells callers to disclose a split in the memo, which makes it a
  check on honest mistakes rather than a control. A version that held
  regardless would count the credits already on the order, which is the same
  stored fact nothing here reaches.

## What is not modeled yet

This is a prototype. Four things you might reasonably expect are absent.

- **Nothing checks a parameter against the column it's compared with.**
  Projecting `source` from `Account.accountId` says what the value is; it says
  nothing about where a statement puts it. `WHERE region = @source` is accepted
  and runs, because the parameter is logical, the column is physical, and no
  rule joins the two. Statements are sent to the store as written — see
  [statements use your database names](#statements-use-your-database-names) —
  so whoever writes one owns which column each argument lands in.
- **A deterministic check over the call's own arguments has no home.** A
  constraint is settled by a model reading it, so `amount <= 25` written as a
  guard costs a model call and can come back differently twice — see
  [what a judgment costs](#what-a-judgment-costs). The place for a check like
  that is likely the action itself; until there is one, keep it in whatever
  dispatches the call, and whoever wrote the statement owns the correctness of
  what it does.
- **kcmd calls no executor but its own.** A `sql` action runs; an `mcp`, `rest`
  or `grpc` one is published for whoever dispatches it, which is why those three
  name coordinates instead of a statement.
- **The store is Spanner or AlloyDB.** The runtime binds and transacts against
  the database your profile's deployment target names, which may be either of
  those. A model bound to BigQuery publishes its actions and runs none of them.
