# Deploying a semantic model

A *semantic model* describes a business logically — its entities, the
relationships between them, and the metrics computed over them — independent of
where the data physically lives. You author it in a format based on
[Apache Ossie](https://ossie.apache.org/), extended with a first-class deployment
target and binding profiles. `kcmd push` deploys one model to two kinds of
destination at once:

* **Knowledge Catalog, where the model is governed.** It becomes catalog entries —
  one per entity, metric, and the model itself — joined by links for its
  relationships. There it is the single governed definition of the business:
  access-controlled, searchable, and part of the dynamic knowledge graph that gives
  AI agents the semantics and business context to work with your data. Governing
  needs no tables or data, so you can publish a purely logical model before it is
  bound, or govern the model together with its bindings — the catalog serves
  either. `kcmd pull` reconstructs the model from these entries.
* **A data store, where the model becomes queryable.** Consumers ask for business
  concepts — `Customer`, `revenue` — and get consistent, model-defined answers
  rather than re-deriving joins and formulas per query. The store can be
  **analytical**, such as BigQuery for reporting and conversational-analytics
  agents, or **operational**, such as Spanner for the live state an agent reads
  before it acts. Which store a model deploys to is set by its
  [deployment target](#where-a-model-deploys-the-deployment-target); the query
  mechanics are in [Reference](reference.md#what-gets-created-in-bigquery).

Both come from the same source, so a single `push` keeps them in sync and you
never author them separately.

You bind the one logical model to a store with a **binding profile**. A model can
bind to more than one store — an analytical warehouse and an operational database,
say — from a single definition, so `Customer` and `revenue` mean the same thing
wherever they are served. See [Binding profiles](profiles.md).

This page is the operation reference: author the logical model, govern it in
Knowledge Catalog, bind it to a store, then update and pull. For a single runnable
example that carries one model through the whole lifecycle, see the
[codelab](codelab.md); for the Ossie document format itself, see
[ossie.apache.org](https://ossie.apache.org/).

## Prerequisites

`kcmd` uses your `gcloud` configuration for credentials, project, and location.
Before pushing, authenticate and make sure a project and region are set — `kcmd`
errors out immediately if any of the three is missing:

```bash
gcloud auth application-default login
gcloud config set project <your-project>
gcloud config set compute/region <your-region>
```

You also need read/write access to whichever destinations you deploy to — see
[Permissions](reference.md#permissions).

## 1. Author the logical model

Create the local layout. The scope is the Knowledge Catalog entry group the
model will be published to, written as `<projectId>.<locationId>.<entryGroupId>`:

```bash
kcmd init --semantic-model my-project.us-central1.my_model
```

`init` provisions that entry group (idempotent — an existing group is fine) and
creates its local directory. Author the model at
`catalog/EntryGroups/<entryGroupId>/<model>.yaml`. The logical model names the
business and nothing physical — the entities, their fields, the relationships
between them, and the metrics computed over them:

```yaml
version: "0.2.0.dev0/google"

semantic_model:
  - name: sales                      # keep equal to the <model>.yaml filename (pull round-trips to that name)
    entities:                        # each entity is one concept
      - name: orders
        primary_key: [order_id]
        fields:
          - { name: order_id,   datatype: Integer }
          - { name: net_amount, datatype: Decimal }
      - name: customer
        primary_key: [customer_id]
        fields:
          - { name: customer_id, datatype: Integer }
          - { name: name,        datatype: String }
    relationships:
      - name: placed_by
        from: orders
        to: customer
        from_columns: [customer_id]
        to_columns: [customer_id]
    metrics:
      - name: revenue
        expression: SUM(orders.net_amount)
```

Field and relationship names are the business vocabulary — `order_id`,
`placed_by` — never physical column names; the physical binding comes later. A
metric's `expression` may be a bare formula over the logical fields or the fuller
per-dialect form. `entities` may also be written `datasets` (the two are interchangeable under the `/google` version).

Entities can **extend** other entities (`extends: [Parent]`); push flattens the
supertype's fields down and expresses the hierarchy as graph labels, so a query
against the supertype gathers every subtype. See
[Modeling class hierarchies](inheritance.md) to model one step by step, and
[Class hierarchies](reference.md#class-hierarchies-extends--labels) for the rules
push enforces.

A model can also declare **actions**: model-level write operations, the
write-side counterpart to a metric. An action names a business operation, points
at the executor that carries it out (an MCP tool, a REST endpoint, a gRPC
method, DML, or a reviewer for a write composed at call time), and types each
parameter against the ontology, so an
entity-typed parameter is an object reference rather than a bare string. The
executor is a physical binding, so a [binding profile](profiles.md) can supply a
different one per store. An action also
names, in `guards`, the constraints that gate it, and in `affects`, the concepts
the call changes — the executor is an opaque handle, so its blast radius is
declared or it is unknown. Knowledge Catalog is the only system an action
reaches, and the only place it is governed. See
[Modeling write operations](actions.md).

A model can also state **constraints**: named invariants over the ontology that
hold for every instance, whatever writes to the model. A constraint is part of
what the model asserts, and `Account.balance >= 0` is as much a fact about an
account as the fields beside it. Most are boolean expressions in the same
language as a metric. A rule no expression decides — whether a discount is
justified by the reason given — is stated in words instead, under `judgment`,
with the field names it mentions written model-qualified so they are checked
like any other reference. A constraint that reads an action's parameters
describes one call rather than the stored data. It can be checked only before
that call runs, so the action names it in `guards`. A constraint reaches
Knowledge Catalog only: it is validated, published there, and read back by
`pull`. No component checks one against live data or asks a model to settle a
judgment yet.

This model names no table and no store, so it is complete enough to govern in
Knowledge Catalog as-is (step 2). Where each entity reads from — the store and the
columns — is a binding you add in step 3.

## 2. Govern it in Knowledge Catalog

The logical model is complete enough to govern right now, with no tables, no data,
and no store. A model that declares no deployment target has nowhere to deploy in a
store, so a bare `kcmd push` writes it to Knowledge Catalog alone:

```bash
kcmd push --validate-only --print   # preview the entries and links, write nothing
kcmd push                           # write them
```

Push creates one entry per entity and metric, one for the model itself, and a
`schema-join` link for each relationship:

```
Wrote 4 new and 0 updated Knowledge Catalog entries; linked 1 relationship.
```

Those entries are the single governed definition of the business. They are
access-controlled, searchable, and joined into the dynamic knowledge graph that
gives AI agents the semantics and business context to reason over your data, and
`kcmd pull` reconstructs the model document from them (see [Pull](#pull)).
Governance works whether the model is purely logical or already bound: govern it
before it has any physical home, or govern the logical model together with its
bindings. Every store you bind it to later serves this one definition. (Running
`--no-kc` on a model with no deployment target is an error — it would have nowhere
to deploy.)

> Writing these entries needs the `semantic-model` / `semantic-entity` /
> `semantic-metric` entry types and write access to the entry group. See
> [Permissions](reference.md#permissions).

## 3. Bind and deploy to a store

To make the model queryable, bind it to a store: name where each entity reads
from, which column each field maps to, and which store the model deploys to. You
can put these bindings directly on the model, or keep them in a separate **binding
profile** so one logical model serves several stores. See
[Binding profiles](profiles.md); for a runnable end-to-end that binds the same
model to BigQuery and Spanner and queries each, see the [codelab](codelab.md).

Once the model is bound, `kcmd push` deploys to the store its target names and to
Knowledge Catalog. The most common flags:

```bash
kcmd push                      # deploy to the store (default binding) + Knowledge Catalog
kcmd push --no-kc              # deploy only to the store, skip Knowledge Catalog
kcmd push --no-profile         # publish only to Knowledge Catalog, deploy to no store
kcmd push --profile analytical # deploy with one binding profile; its target picks the store
kcmd push --all-profiles       # deploy once per binding profile
kcmd push --validate-only      # run all checks, write nothing
kcmd push --print              # also print the generated DDL / entry plan
```

A push has two axes. The **binding-profile axis** sets how many profiles the model
deploys for: the default binding, `--no-profile` (none — catalog only), a single
`--profile`, or every one with `--all-profiles`. The **Knowledge Catalog axis** is
`--no-kc` (skip the catalog leg). You never name the store on the command line; the
model's deployment target — or the [profile](profiles.md) you merge — selects it.
The store leg deploys first and fails fast, so a rejected model never
half-deploys; the checks that gate it are in
[Validation](reference.md#validation), and the full flag list is in
[Reference → push](reference.md#push).

### Where a model deploys (the deployment target)

A bound model declares exactly one **deployment target**: where in a store the
model deploys. The host of the target URI selects the store:

```
# BigQuery — an analytical store
//bigquery.googleapis.com/projects/<project>/datasets/<dataset>/propertyGraphs/<name>

# Spanner — an operational store
//spanner.googleapis.com/projects/<project>/instances/<instance>/databases/<database>/propertyGraphs/<name>
```

A BigQuery target names the project and dataset the model deploys into; a Spanner
target names the instance and database. Swapping one target URI for the other
deploys the same model to the other store — the logical model does not change. The
target is also recorded on the model's Knowledge Catalog entry. A model with more
than one deployment target is rejected at push time (see
[Validation](reference.md#validation)).

For a model that serves more than one store, the target belongs to a
[binding profile](profiles.md) rather than the model. `deployment_target` is a
resource URI and a native key under the extended `0.2.0.dev0/google` profile; under
vanilla Ossie the same target is written inside a `GOOGLE` custom extension instead
(see [model spec §6](model_spec.md#6-the-extension-mechanism)).

### Table sources

Each entity's `source` names its backing table, written as a resource URI:
`//bigquery.googleapis.com/…/tables/<table>` for BigQuery,
`//spanner.googleapis.com/…/tables/<table>` for Spanner. A
[binding profile](profiles.md) can move an entity between stores by swapping this
URI.

For BigQuery, a shorthand dotted name also works: `dataset.table` (two parts) is
qualified with the scope's project from `init`, and `project.dataset.table` names
a table in another project. A name with more than three parts — a four-part
`catalog.database.schema.table`, say — points at a table in a **federated REST
catalog**, such as an Apache Iceberg table exposed through BigLake. Validation
resolves the name the same way the deploy does (see
[Validation](reference.md#validation)).

### What push creates

In **BigQuery**, a single `CREATE OR REPLACE PROPERTY GRAPH` per deployment
target: each entity becomes a node table, each relationship an edge table, each
metric a measure. In **Spanner**, the same `CREATE OR REPLACE PROPERTY GRAPH` with
bare table names and no measures — Spanner Graph has no `MEASURE`, so metrics are
dropped with a warning while the graph structure (nodes, edges, labels,
inheritance) still deploys. In **Knowledge Catalog**, one entry per model, entity,
and metric, plus `schema-join` links for relationships. The exact mapping — and
the class-hierarchy handling — is in
[Reference → What gets created](reference.md#what-gets-created-in-bigquery) (and
[in Spanner](reference.md#what-gets-created-in-spanner)); what of your metadata
survives the trip (and what doesn't) is in
[What push and pull preserve](fidelity.md).

## Updating and removing models

Your model document is the source of truth. To change what is deployed, edit
the document and run `kcmd push` again — you never edit the catalog or the
deployed store by hand. Re-running is safe: each push makes the destinations
match the document as it stands now.

**When you edit an entity, metric, or relationship** — push overwrites the
existing one in place; you don't get duplicates.

**When you delete an entity or metric** — remove it from the document and
push. Push deletes the leftover catalog entry for you (the summary shows
`removed N orphaned entries`).

**When you rename or delete a relationship** — push removes the old
`schema-join` link after writing the new ones, so a rename never leaves the
two entities disconnected (the summary shows `unlinked N orphaned links`). Push
reconciles only the links of the model it is deploying, and an entry group holds
exactly one model, so it never disturbs another model's links.

**When you remove a whole model** — deleting its document does *not* remove it
from the catalog. As long as you still push at least one other model in the same
entry group, push stops and names the model the catalog still has that you no
longer push, so you can't wipe one out by accident or by pushing from the wrong
directory; run push again with `--force-remove` to delete its entries and links.
Deleting *every* document is the exception: with no models left to push, the run
reports `No semantic model documents found; nothing to deploy` and touches
nothing — so remove a model while other models in its group remain, or delete
its catalog entries directly.

Every push prints one line per destination summarizing what it did. For a push
that deploys to both the store and Knowledge Catalog:

```
Deployed 1 BigQuery Graph(s).
Wrote 5 new and 2 updated Knowledge Catalog entries; removed 1 orphaned entry; linked 2 relationships; unlinked 1 orphaned link.
```

A Spanner-targeting model prints `Deployed 1 Spanner Graph(s).` in place of the
BigQuery line.

## Pull

`kcmd pull` is the inverse of push's Knowledge Catalog leg: it reads the
`semantic-*` entries back from the catalog and reconstructs local model
documents at `catalog/EntryGroups/<entryGroupId>/<model>.yaml`. Use it to
recover a workspace from a catalog someone else deployed, or to see what the
catalog actually holds.

```bash
kcmd pull
```

Pull reads only from Knowledge Catalog (never the data store). Its coordinates come
from the same scope you authored under (`<projectId>.<locationId>.<entryGroupId>`).
The `--dry-run` and `--force-remove` flags are in
[Reference → pull flags](reference.md#pull).

An entry group holds **exactly one** semantic model. Pull reconstructs that one
model's document; a group with more than one `semantic-model` anchor is an
unexpected state, so pull stops and names the anchors rather than guess which to
keep.

Pull overwrites a model that already exists locally in place. If the catalog's
model has a **different name** than the one on disk, writing it would leave the
entry group holding two models — so by default pull stops and reports the
mismatch instead of deleting anything. Re-run with `--force-remove` to delete the
local model and replace it with the catalog's. Pull never touches the data store.

Pull can only return what push wrote, so a push→pull round trip is **not** an
identity — see [What push and pull preserve](fidelity.md) for exactly what
comes back, what comes back normalized, and what doesn't come back at all. Keep
your authored document as the source of truth.

## Importing an OWL ontology

Already have an OWL ontology? `kcmd owl import` converts it into a semantic model
once — classes → entities, object properties → relationships, datatype
properties → fields. The converted model is **unbound** (no sources, no
deployment target), so bind each entity's `source`, fill the relationship join
columns, and add a deployment target before `kcmd push` will deploy it — then it
rides the normal push / pull above. See [Importing an OWL ontology](owl-import.md).
