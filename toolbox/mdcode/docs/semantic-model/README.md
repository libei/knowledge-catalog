# Deploying a semantic model

A *semantic model* describes your entities (tables), the metrics computed over
them, and the relationships between them, authored as a single
[Apache Ossie](https://ossie.apache.org/) document. `kcmd push` deploys one
model to two destinations at once:

* **A property graph** — a queryable `CREATE OR REPLACE PROPERTY GRAPH` over the
  model's tables, so the model can be traversed (and, on BigQuery, its metrics
  computed) in SQL. The graph backend is **BigQuery Graph** or **Spanner
  Graph**, chosen by the deployment target you declare — the same authored model
  deploys to either (see [Deployment targets](#deployment-targets-required)).
* **Knowledge Catalog** — catalog entries and links that make the
  model discoverable as metadata.

Both are generated from the same source document — you never author them
separately, and a single `push` keeps them in sync.

This page is the deploy walkthrough: author a model, push it, update it, pull it
back. For the Ossie document format itself, see
[ossie.apache.org](https://ossie.apache.org/).

## Prerequisites

`kcmd` uses your `gcloud` configuration for credentials, project, and location.
Before pushing, authenticate and make sure a project and region are set — `kcmd`
errors out immediately if any of the three is missing:

```bash
gcloud auth application-default login
gcloud config set project <your-project>
gcloud config set compute/region <your-region>
```

You also need read/write access to whichever destinations you deploy to — see
[Permissions](reference.md#permissions).

## 1. Author a model

Create the local layout. The scope is the Knowledge Catalog entry group the
model will be published to, written as `<projectId>.<locationId>.<entryGroupId>`:

```bash
kcmd init --semantic-model my-project.us-central1.my_model
```

`init` provisions that entry group (idempotent — an existing group is fine) and
creates its local directory. Author the model at
`catalog/EntryGroups/<entryGroupId>/<model>.yaml`:

```yaml
version: "0.2.0.dev0"

semantic_model:
  - name: sales                              # keep equal to the <model>.yaml filename (pull round-trips to that name)
    # Required: the deployment target, in a GOOGLE custom extension. `data` is a
    # JSON string whose deploymentTargets holds the target graph URI (for now,
    # exactly one).
    custom_extensions:
      - vendor_name: GOOGLE
        data: '{"deploymentTargets": ["//bigquery.googleapis.com/projects/my-project/datasets/sales/propertyGraphs/sales_graph"]}'
    datasets:                                # each dataset becomes an entity
      - name: orders
        source: my-project.sales.orders      # the backing BigQuery table
        primary_key: [o_orderkey]
        fields:
          - name: o_orderkey
            expression: {dialects: [{dialect: BIGQUERY, expression: o_orderkey}]}
          - name: o_totalprice
            expression: {dialects: [{dialect: BIGQUERY, expression: o_totalprice}]}
    metrics:
      - name: total_revenue
        expression: {dialects: [{dialect: BIGQUERY, expression: SUM(orders.o_totalprice)}]}
```

Entities can **extend** other entities (`extends: [Parent]`); push flattens the
supertype's fields down and expresses the hierarchy as BigQuery labels. See
[Class hierarchies](reference.md#class-hierarchies-extends--labels) for the
rules.

A model can also declare **actions** — named write operations over the ontology,
the write-side counterpart to metrics — and **constraints**, the invariants an
action must not break. See [Actions](#actions-write-operations) and
[Constraints](#constraints-invariants) below.

### Deployment targets (required)

Every model must declare exactly one **deployment target** — the property graph
it deploys to — in a `GOOGLE` custom extension, as shown above. The target's
**host selects the graph backend**:

```
# BigQuery Graph
//bigquery.googleapis.com/projects/<project>/datasets/<dataset>/propertyGraphs/<graphName>

# Spanner Graph
//spanner.googleapis.com/projects/<project>/instances/<instance>/databases/<database>/propertyGraphs/<graphName>
```

A BigQuery target's project and dataset are where the property graph is created;
a Spanner target's instance and database are. Swapping one target URI for the
other is all it takes to deploy the same model to the other backend. The target
is also recorded on the model's Knowledge Catalog entry. A model with no
deployment target — or with more than one — is rejected at push time (see
[Validation](reference.md#validation)).

### Table sources

Each entity's `source` is its backing table.

For a **BigQuery** target, `source` is the BigQuery table. A `source` written as
`dataset.table` (two parts) is qualified with the scope's project — the
`<projectId>` from `init`. Write the full `project.dataset.table` when a table
lives in another project. Sources are not limited to native BigQuery tables: a
name with more than three parts — for example a four-part
`catalog.database.schema.table` reference — points at a table in a **federated
REST catalog**, such as an Apache Iceberg table exposed through BigLake. Write it
exactly as BigQuery resolves the name, and validation resolves it the same way
the deploy does (see [Validation](reference.md#validation)).

For a **Spanner** target, the graph and its tables live inside the one Spanner
database the target names, so a `source` is reduced to its **final segment** —
the table name in that database (`demo.sales.Orders` → `Orders`). That lets one
authored `source` serve both backends; a Spanner-native `source` form is a
planned [profiles](profiles.md) feature.

### Actions (write operations)

Where a metric reads a value over the ontology, an **action** *changes state*.
Both are model-level and defined over the concepts, not bound to a single entity;
the difference is direction. An action names a business operation and leaves the
mechanics to an **executor**; the model contributes only what the ontology can
say that a plain tool schema cannot — **parameters typed by the ontology**, where
a scalar type is an ordinary value and an **entity type is an object reference**.

```yaml
    actions:
      - name: PlaceOrder
        description: Create an order for a customer   # informational; does not affect runtime
        executor:                                     # exactly one kind: mcp / rest / grpc
          mcp:
            server: //agentregistry.googleapis.com/projects/acme-ops/locations/us-central1/mcpServers/commerce
            tool: place_order                         # the tool's name within that server
        parameters:                                   # each input an entity (object reference) or a scalar
          - {name: customer, type: customer}          # `customer` is an entity -> an object reference
          - {name: quantity, type: Integer}           # a scalar value
```

The `mcp` executor **references** a tool already registered in Agent Registry, by
the server's resource name plus the tool's name; `rest` (`{endpoint, method}`)
and `grpc` (`{service, method}`) are the other kinds. Exactly one kind is
required.

Actions are **write-side, so they have no BigQuery Graph representation** — the
push emits no node/edge/measure for them and warns once that they were not placed
in the graph. They are published to **Knowledge Catalog** instead, on the model's
anchor entry (see
[What gets created in Knowledge Catalog](reference.md#what-gets-created-in-knowledge-catalog)),
and a `pull` recovers them. This is a prototype: an action's own `precondition`
and `affects` (its per-action gate and blast radius) are **not** modeled yet —
the gate today is model-level, expressed as [constraints](#constraints-invariants).
[Modeling write operations](actions.md) walks the whole path, from declaring an
action to running one against a live store.

### Constraints (invariants)

A **constraint** is a named boolean invariant over the ontology — something that
must hold for every instance, whatever writes to the model. Constraints are
model-level like metrics and actions, and written in the same expression
language:

```yaml
    constraints:
      - name: NonNegativeBalance
        expression: Customer.accountBalance >= 0
        description: >-
          A customer's account balance cannot go negative. Reduce the order
          quantity or choose a customer with more available balance.
      - name: PositiveQuantity
        expression: OrderedAs.quantity > 0
        description: An order line must be for at least one unit.
```

Constraints exist because actions change state: an agent running an action
writes to a live store, and a bad write corrupts data. A constraint is checked
**before the action commits** — if the write would leave any instance violating
it, the action is rejected and nothing changes.

Write the `description` as the message you want the caller to act on. It is
surfaced verbatim as the violation error, so an agent that gets rejected can
read it and choose a different move ("reduce the order quantity") instead of
retrying the same call.

Like actions, constraints are **not** part of the graph — the push emits nothing
for them and warns once, then publishes them to **Knowledge Catalog** on the
model's anchor entry, where a `pull` recovers them.

Enforcing a constraint is a separate job from publishing it, and `demo/action/`
shows what that looks like: a runtime resolves an action's entity-typed
arguments, applies the write in a transaction, checks every constraint against
the uncommitted result, and either commits or rolls back with the violated
constraint's `description`. That demo also exposes the action over MCP, so an
agent that gets rejected reads the description and corrects its next call.

## 2. Push

```bash
kcmd push
```

With no flags this deploys to **every** destination — the model's graph backend
(BigQuery Graph or Spanner Graph, whichever its target names) and Knowledge
Catalog — the graph first. You don't pick the graph backend on the command line;
the model's deployment target (or the [profile](profiles.md) you merge) does. The
most common flags:

```bash
kcmd push                      # deploy the graph (default binding) + Knowledge Catalog
kcmd push --no-kc              # deploy only the graph, skip Knowledge Catalog
kcmd push --no-profile         # publish only to Knowledge Catalog, deploy no graph
kcmd push --profile analytical # deploy the graph with one binding profile; its target picks the backend
kcmd push --all-profiles       # deploy the graph once per binding profile
kcmd push --validate-only      # run all checks, write nothing
kcmd push --print              # also print the generated DDL / entry plan
```

A push has two axes. The **binding-profile axis** sets how many profiles the
graph deploys for: the default binding, `--no-profile` (none — catalog only), a
single `--profile`, or every one with `--all-profiles`. The **Knowledge Catalog
axis** is `--no-kc` (skip the catalog leg). Both default on, so a bare push
deploys the default graph and records to the catalog. See
[Binding profiles](profiles.md).

A logical model that declares no deployment target has no graph to deploy, so a
bare `kcmd push` records it to Knowledge Catalog alone (and `--no-kc` on such a
model is an error — it would have nowhere to go).

See [Reference → push flags](reference.md#push) for the full list. The graph leg
deploys first and fails fast, so a rejected model never half-deploys — the checks
that gate it are in [Validation](reference.md#validation).

**What push creates.** In **BigQuery**, a single `CREATE OR REPLACE PROPERTY
GRAPH` per deployment target: each entity becomes a node table, each relationship
an edge table, each metric a measure. In **Spanner**, the same
`CREATE OR REPLACE PROPERTY GRAPH` with bare table names and no measures —
Spanner Graph has no `MEASURE`, so metrics are dropped with a warning while the
graph structure (nodes, edges, labels, inheritance) still deploys. In
**Knowledge Catalog**, one entry per model, entity, and metric, plus
`schema-join` links for relationships. The exact mapping — and the
class-hierarchy handling — is in
[Reference → What gets created](reference.md#what-gets-created-in-bigquery) (and
[in Spanner](reference.md#what-gets-created-in-spanner)); what of your metadata
survives the trip (and what doesn't) is in
[What push and pull preserve](fidelity.md).

## Updating and removing models

Your model document is the source of truth. To change what is deployed, edit
the document and run `kcmd push` again — you never edit the catalog or the
BigQuery Graph by hand. Re-running is safe: each push makes the destinations
match the document as it stands now.

**When you edit an entity, metric, or relationship** — push overwrites the
existing one in place; you don't get duplicates.

**When you delete an entity or metric** — remove it from the document and
push. Push deletes the leftover catalog entry for you (the summary shows
`removed N orphaned entries`).

**When you rename or delete a relationship** — push removes the old
`schema-join` link after writing the new ones, so a rename never leaves the
two entities disconnected (the summary shows `unlinked N orphaned links`). Push
reconciles only the links of the model it is deploying, and an entry group holds
exactly one model, so it never disturbs another model's links.

**When you remove a whole model** — deleting its document does *not* remove it
from the catalog. As long as you still push at least one other model in the same
entry group, push stops and names the model the catalog still has that you no
longer push, so you can't wipe one out by accident or by pushing from the wrong
directory; run push again with `--force-remove` to delete its entries and links.
Deleting *every* document is the exception: with no models left to push, the run
reports `No semantic model documents found; nothing to deploy` and touches
nothing — so remove a model while other models in its group remain, or delete
its catalog entries directly.

Every push prints one line per destination summarizing what it did. For a push
that deploys both the graph and Knowledge Catalog:

```
Deployed 1 BigQuery Graph(s).
Wrote 5 new and 2 updated Knowledge Catalog entries; removed 1 orphaned entry; linked 2 relationships; unlinked 1 orphaned link.
```

A Spanner-targeting model prints `Deployed 1 Spanner Graph(s).` in place of the
BigQuery line.

## Pull

`kcmd pull` is the inverse of push's Knowledge Catalog leg: it reads the
`semantic-*` entries back from the catalog and reconstructs local model
documents at `catalog/EntryGroups/<entryGroupId>/<model>.yaml`. Use it to
recover a workspace from a catalog someone else deployed, or to see what the
catalog actually holds.

```bash
kcmd pull
```

Pull reads only from Knowledge Catalog (never BigQuery). Its coordinates come
from the same scope you authored under (`<projectId>.<locationId>.<entryGroupId>`).
The `--dry-run` and `--force-remove` flags are in
[Reference → pull flags](reference.md#pull).

An entry group holds **exactly one** semantic model. Pull reconstructs that one
model's document; a group with more than one `semantic-model` anchor is an
unexpected state, so pull stops and names the anchors rather than guess which to
keep.

Pull overwrites a model that already exists locally in place. If the catalog's
model has a **different name** than the one on disk, writing it would leave the
entry group holding two models — so by default pull stops and reports the
mismatch instead of deleting anything. Re-run with `--force-remove` to delete the
local model and replace it with the catalog's. Pull never touches BigQuery.

Pull can only return what push wrote, so a push→pull round trip is **not** an
identity — see [What push and pull preserve](fidelity.md) for exactly what
comes back, what comes back normalized, and what doesn't come back at all. Keep
your authored document as the source of truth.

## Importing an OWL ontology

Already have an OWL ontology? `kcmd owl import` converts it into a semantic model
once — classes → entities, object properties → relationships, datatype
properties → fields. The converted model is **unbound** (placeholder sources, no
deployment target), so bind each entity's `source`, fill the relationship join
columns, and add a deployment target before `kcmd push` will deploy it — then it
rides the normal push / pull above. See [Importing an OWL ontology](owl-import.md).
