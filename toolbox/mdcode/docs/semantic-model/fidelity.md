# What push and pull preserve

Your model document is the source of truth. Pushing it — to Knowledge Catalog
and to a property graph in BigQuery or Spanner — and pulling it back are each
**lossy in specific ways**. The catalog keeps metadata, the graph keeps what it
can query, and `pull` can only return what the catalog was given. This page is
the one authoritative map of what survives each direction. Keep your authored
document.

Which backend a push deploys to — BigQuery or Spanner — is set by the model's
deployment target, or by the binding profile you select; it is not a
command-line flag. What reaches Knowledge Catalog depends on the push as well: a
catalog-only or purely logical push records the whole model, while a push that
also deploys a graph records only the part the graph binds. Both are detailed
under [To Knowledge Catalog](#to-knowledge-catalog).

## The round-trip matrix

Rows are what you authored; columns are its fate in each direction. `✓` = comes
back as authored; `—` = not present in that destination. Footnotes carry the
nuances that don't fit a cell. BigQuery and Spanner each get a column; they
agree on every structural row and differ only where a Spanner target has no
`MEASURE` and no `OPTIONS` metadata — see [To Spanner](#to-spanner).

1. **Field type source.** The graph uses the source column's own type; a
   field's authored `datatype` is not carried.
2. **Field type collapses.** Field types round-trip except two collapses: no
   type → `Opaque`, and `String` → un-typed. Both store as `dataType STRING`,
   disambiguated by `metadataType` (`OTHER` → read back as `Opaque`; `STRING` →
   read back un-typed) — which is what lets them round-trip differently.
3. **Dimension role.** The default push omits the per-field `semantics` block,
   so the dimension role is written only with `--emit-expressions` — and then
   comes back as a bare `dimension: {}` marker (without `is_time`, and so on). A
   default push drops the marker entirely.
4. **Metric shape.** A metric must resolve to exactly one entity (otherwise the
   push is rejected) and reduce to one supported aggregate — `SUM` / `AVG` /
   `COUNT` / `MIN` / `MAX` — over one operand (otherwise it is skipped with a
   warning).
5. **Metric type.** A metric's expression is gated behind `--emit-expressions`;
   its data type round-trips only for a concrete type (e.g. `Decimal`) — an
   untyped, `String`, or `Opaque` metric comes back un-typed.
6. **Relationship name.** Relationship names come back lowercased/hyphenated
   (`Places Order` → `places-order`) — the catalog stores the name only in the
   link id. See [Writer-side follow-up](#writer-side-follow-up).
7. **Guidelines aspect.** The `guidelines` aspect exists only for the model,
   entities, and metrics — not fields or relationships, so field- and
   relationship-level `ai_context.instructions` has no Knowledge Catalog home (a
   relationship's instructions still reach BigQuery, folded into the edge's
   `OPTIONS(description)`).
8. **Model-level metadata.** Neither graph has a home for statement-level
   metadata — BigQuery silently drops graph-statement `OPTIONS`, and Spanner
   carries no `OPTIONS` at all — so the model's `description` and
   `ai_context.instructions` are carried into Knowledge Catalog instead.
9. **Other custom extensions.** Under the vanilla `0.2.0.dev0` profile a
   `custom_extensions` block (other than a GOOGLE deployment target) is the only
   carrier for vendor metadata; it is inert on push and not persisted to
   Knowledge Catalog, so `pull` never recovers it. `pull` also emits the extended
   `0.2.0.dev0/google` profile, which has no `custom_extensions` carrier, so such
   a block is not re-serialized either — keep your authored file. The OWL importer
   emits none: it is import-only (see [Importing an OWL
   ontology](owl-import.md)).
10. **Logical (unbound) model.** A model with no bindings still publishes to
    Knowledge Catalog: each entity's `source` is recorded empty (`resources: []`)
    because there is no table behind it, and a relationship that carries no join
    columns is skipped with a warning. When the same push also deploys a graph,
    the catalog entries are first pruned to what the graph binds — see
    [To Knowledge Catalog](#to-knowledge-catalog).
11. **Vendor-dialect fallback.** What you author is the `expression.dialects[]`
    list; the graph builds from the canonical (BigQuery/ANSI) variant.
    `importedExpression` / `importedDialect` are not authored keys — the loader
    *derives* them from a non-canonical dialect entry (for example the MAQL or
    Snowflake form a metric was imported from) and uses that verbatim as the
    fallback when no canonical variant exists. See
    [Model spec §2.5](model_spec.md#25-expressions).
12. **Actions.** An action reaches Knowledge Catalog only, as one
    `semantic-action` entry under the model entry, and `pull` reads it back from
    that entry. Every other push target deploys nothing for it and warns once.
    Its `guards` are stored as constraint names and round-trip verbatim. A name
    whose constraint is absent from a pull is kept rather than dropped, so a
    partial pull never silently rewrites the author's model; the pull warns
    about the name it kept, and a push rejects the model until the constraint
    is back. A name the aspect repeats is the one exception, dropped to its
    single occurrence because the loader rejects a repeat and the document has
    to stay loadable. Its `affects` round-trips the same way, with the same
    exception for a repeated concept-and-operation pair. See
    [Modeling write operations](actions.md).
13. **Constraints.** A constraint reaches Knowledge Catalog only, as one
    `semantic-constraint` entry under the model entry, and `pull` reads it back.
    Every other push target deploys nothing for it and warns once. Publishing is
    all that happens to a constraint; no component checks one against live
    data.

## To Knowledge Catalog

The catalog holds metadata rather than a full copy of your model. Every resource
type it uses is a built-in system type under `dataplex-types/global`, apart from
the custom `semantic-action` and `semantic-constraint` pairs that `kcmd init`
provisions. A push references those types and never creates them (see
[Reference → What gets created in Knowledge Catalog](reference.md#what-gets-created-in-knowledge-catalog)).

What is recorded depends on the push. A catalog-only push (`--no-profile`), or a
purely logical model with no bindings, records the whole model: every entity,
metric, and relationship the document declares. A push that also deploys a graph
first prunes the model to what that graph binds, so an unbound field — and any
entity, metric, or relationship that depends on it — is left out of the catalog
entries too. A pull of such a push returns the bound view rather than the full
authored model.

A logical model still produces complete entries. Each entity's `source` is
recorded empty (`resources: []`) because there is no table behind it, and a
relationship that carries no join columns is skipped with a warning.

By default the catalog does **not** store the SQL expressions: the published
system-type templates do not yet carry a per-field `semantics` block or a
`semantic-metric.expression` field, so the default push omits them. Pass
`--emit-expressions` to write the canonical GoogleSQL/ANSI expression once the
templates gain the fields. The catalog never stores `ai_context.synonyms` /
`examples`, field-level `ai_context` (only model, entity, and metric
`instructions` have a home, in the `guidelines` aspect), or the original vendor
SQL (`importedExpression` — for example the MAQL or Snowflake form a metric was
imported from). Those stay in your authored document; the vendor SQL and
expressions are still used when generating graph SQL.

**Actions** follow the same one-entry-per-element rule as everything else: each
becomes a `semantic-action` entry under the model entry, carrying its executor,
typed parameters, `guards`, and `affects` in a `semantic-action` aspect. They
round-trip losslessly through `pull` (name, description, executor, typed
parameters, `guards`, `affects`, and `instructions`). A parameter's
`isEntityRef` is re-derived against the entities the pull recovered rather than
read back from the aspect, so it stays consistent with the model the pull hands
you. The entry type is custom, so `kcmd init` creates it; a model that declares
no action never needs it.

What an action affects round-trips as a fact, not as the text it was authored
in. The two authored shapes — the bare name and the record — are one shape in
the model, so a record carrying nothing but a concept (`- concept: Account`)
comes back as the bare `Account`, which says the same thing. Everything after
that first pass is byte-for-byte stable.

`affects` stores only what the author wrote, which is why it survives a partial
pull intact. Whether a `concept` is an entity or an edge is not recorded, so
nothing about it has to be re-resolved — and nothing can go stale. That matters
most for a many-to-many relationship, which never reaches the catalog at all: a
pull recovers relationships from the schema-join entry links, which carry the
foreign-key edges only, so a concept naming an M:N edge would look unresolvable
on a model that is perfectly well-formed. It comes back untouched instead.

**Constraints** publish the same way: each becomes a `semantic-constraint` entry
under the model entry, with the expression and any `instructions` in a
`semantic-constraint` aspect and the `description` as the entry's own summary.
Name, expression, description, and instructions round-trip losslessly through
`pull`. That entry type is custom too, and a model that declares no constraint
never needs it.

¹⁰ What you author is the `expression.dialects[]` list; the graph builds from the canonical (BigQuery/ANSI) variant. `importedExpression` / `importedDialect` are not authored keys — the loader *derives* them from a non-canonical dialect entry (e.g. the MAQL or Snowflake form a metric was imported from) and uses that verbatim as the fallback when no canonical variant exists. See [Model spec §2.5](model_spec.md#25-expressions).

## To BigQuery

Push preserves both the queryable structure and the descriptive metadata attached
to it. The structure becomes the node tables, edge tables, and measures; the
descriptive metadata is written into each element's `OPTIONS(...)` in the graph
(visible with `--print`).

BigQuery's graph `OPTIONS` give an element a `description` string and a `synonyms`
array. `synonyms` is the only part with a dedicated option, so it carries across
structurally, as its own array. The rest — `description`, `instructions`,
`examples`, and a field's `label` — share the single `description` string, so
they are combined into it (examples as an `Examples: …` line). Their content is
preserved; their separate structure is not.

The model's own statement-level metadata has nowhere to go: BigQuery silently
drops graph-statement `OPTIONS`, so the model's `description` / `ai_context` are
not in the graph — the `description` and `ai_context.instructions` are carried
into Knowledge Catalog instead. Unique keys beyond the primary key are also
dropped (only the primary key is emitted). The imported vendor SQL is not carried
as a separate form: the graph builds from the canonical `expression` when
present, and falls back to the imported vendor SQL verbatim only when the model
was never transpiled to a canonical form.

## To Spanner

A Spanner target keeps the queryable **structure** and drops the descriptive
metadata. The node tables, edge tables, and labels (including the `extends`
hierarchy, with fields flattened down) deploy exactly as they do for BigQuery,
but with bare table and graph names. Two things do not make the trip, both by
design:

- **Metrics.** Spanner has no `MEASURE`, so every model-level metric is
  dropped with a warning. The BigQuery-only rule that a metric resolve to one
  entity does not apply. Author your metrics as usual — a BigQuery target still
  emits them, and Knowledge Catalog still records each `semantic-metric` entry —
  they simply have no home in the Spanner graph.
- **`OPTIONS` metadata.** Spanner carries no per-element `OPTIONS`, so
  `description`, `synonyms`, `instructions`, `examples`, and field `label` are not
  written into the Spanner DDL. They still reach Knowledge Catalog on the same
  push (the model's / entities' / metrics' descriptions and `instructions` land
  on their entries and the `guidelines` aspect), so the descriptive layer lives in
  the catalog rather than in the Spanner graph. This mirrors how BigQuery drops
  its graph-*statement* `OPTIONS` while keeping per-element ones.

Everything else — keys, relationships, the label hierarchy — matches the
**→ BigQuery** column above.

**Actions and constraints** reach neither graph. They are published to
Knowledge Catalog as one `semantic-action` or `semantic-constraint` entry each
and round-trip losslessly through `pull` — see
[To Knowledge Catalog](#to-knowledge-catalog).

## What pull recovers

`pull` returns what push wrote — the **Recovered by `pull`** column above is the
summary. When the push deployed a graph, what push wrote was already pruned to
the bound view (see [To Knowledge Catalog](#to-knowledge-catalog)), so pull
returns that view. Two things about *how* it comes back:

**Normalized** — the content survives, the form changes:

- Relationship *names* come back lowercased/hyphenated (`Places Order` →
  `places-order`); the catalog stores the name only in the link id. See
  [Writer-side follow-up](#writer-side-follow-up).
- Field types round-trip except two collapses: a field authored with no type
  comes back as `Opaque`, and a field authored as `String` comes back un-typed
  (both store `dataType STRING`, kept distinct by a field's `metadataType` — see
  footnote ²). A metric's data
  type round-trips only for a concrete type (e.g. `Decimal`); an untyped,
  `String`, or `Opaque` metric comes back un-typed, because the metric aspect
  stores a data type but no metadata type to mark it `Opaque`.
- A field's dimension role (present only if pushed with `--emit-expressions`)
  comes back as a bare `dimension: {}` marker, without its detail (`is_time`, and
  so on).
- Ordering: field order within each entity is preserved, but the order of
  entities and metrics is not — they come back in the catalog's own order, not
  the authored one. Comments in the original YAML are not preserved.

**So a push followed by a pull does not return your original file.** Treat a
pulled document as a faithful copy of the catalog metadata rather than of the
authored model, and keep the authored document as the source of truth.

## Writer-side follow-up

One reduction above is a limit of what push currently *writes* rather than of
what pull can recover. It is recorded here as a write-side follow-up; the reader
(pull) already returns everything the catalog holds.

- **Relationship names.** The `schema-join` aspect type's `metadataTemplate` has
  no field for the relationship name, so push cannot store it and pull recovers
  it from the link id — which is lowercased and hyphenated (the entry-link id
  format forbids the original casing/underscores). Returning the name verbatim
  requires adding a name field to the built-in `schema-join` aspect type in
  Knowledge Catalog (server-side), after which the client write/read is trivial;
  it is the same class of gap as the `semantics` field that gates
  `--emit-expressions`.

(A non-canonical deployment target is **not** a pull gap: push rejects it at the
validation gate before any leg runs, so it is never written — see
[Validation](reference.md#validation).)
