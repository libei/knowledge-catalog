# What push and pull preserve

Your model document is the source of truth. Pushing it — to Knowledge Catalog
and to a property graph in BigQuery or Spanner — and pulling it back are each
**lossy in specific ways**. The catalog keeps metadata, the graph keeps what it
can query, and `pull` can only return what the catalog was given. This page is
the one authoritative map of what survives each direction. Keep your authored
document.

Which backend a push deploys to — BigQuery or Spanner — is set by the model's
deployment target, or by the binding profile you select; it is not a
command-line flag. What reaches Knowledge Catalog depends on the push as well: a
catalog-only or purely logical push records the whole model, while a push that
also deploys a graph records only the part the graph binds. Both effects are
detailed under [To Knowledge Catalog](#to-knowledge-catalog).

## The round-trip matrix

Rows are what you authored; columns are its fate in each direction. `✓` = comes
back as authored; `—` = not present in that destination. Footnotes carry the
nuances that don't fit a cell. BigQuery and Spanner each get a column; they
agree on every structural row and differ only where a Spanner target has no
`MEASURE` and no `OPTIONS` metadata — see [To Spanner](#to-spanner).

1. **Field type source.** The graph uses the source column's own type; a
   field's authored `datatype` is not carried.
2. **Field type collapses.** Field types round-trip except two collapses: no
   type → `Opaque`, and `String` → un-typed. Both store as `dataType STRING`,
   disambiguated by `metadataType` (`OTHER` → read back as `Opaque`; `STRING` →
   read back un-typed) — which is what lets them round-trip differently.
3. **Dimension role.** The default push omits the per-field `semantics` block,
   so the dimension role is written only with `--emit-expressions` — and then
   comes back as a bare `dimension: {}` marker (without `is_time`, and so on). A
   default push drops the marker entirely.
4. **Metric shape.** A metric must resolve to exactly one entity (otherwise the
   push is rejected) and reduce to one supported aggregate — `SUM` / `AVG` /
   `COUNT` / `MIN` / `MAX` — over one operand (otherwise it is skipped with a
   warning).
5. **Metric type.** A metric's expression is gated behind `--emit-expressions`;
   its data type round-trips only for a concrete type (e.g. `Decimal`) — an
   untyped, `String`, or `Opaque` metric comes back un-typed.
6. **Relationship name.** A one-to-many relationship's name comes back
   lowercased/hyphenated (`Places Order` → `places-order`) — the catalog stores
   the name only in the link id. See
   [Writer-side follow-up](#writer-side-follow-up). A many-to-many relationship
   is stored as an entry, not a link, so its name comes back verbatim.
7. **Guidelines aspect.** The `guidelines` aspect exists only for the model,
   entities, and metrics — not fields or relationships, so field- and
   relationship-level `ai_context.instructions` has no Knowledge Catalog home (a
   relationship's instructions still reach BigQuery, folded into the edge's
   `OPTIONS(description)`). The one exception is a many-to-many relationship,
   whose `semantic-association` aspect carries its `instructions` — that aspect
   type is ours, so it has a field for them.
8. **Model-level metadata.** Neither graph has a home for statement-level
   metadata — BigQuery silently drops graph-statement `OPTIONS`, and Spanner
   carries no `OPTIONS` at all — so the model's `description` and
   `ai_context.instructions` are carried into Knowledge Catalog instead.
9. **Other custom extensions.** Under the vanilla `0.2.0.dev0` profile a
   `custom_extensions` block (other than a GOOGLE deployment target) is the only
   carrier for vendor metadata; it is inert on push and not persisted to
   Knowledge Catalog, so `pull` never recovers it. `pull` also emits the extended
   `0.2.0.dev0/google` profile, which has no `custom_extensions` carrier, so such
   a block is not re-serialized either — keep your authored file. The OWL importer
   emits none: it is import-only (see [Importing an OWL
   ontology](owl-import.md)).
10. **Logical (unbound) model.** A model with no bindings still publishes to
    Knowledge Catalog: each entity's `source` is recorded empty (`resources: []`)
    because there is no table behind it, and a relationship that carries no join
    columns is skipped with a warning. When the same push also deploys a graph,
    the catalog entries are first pruned to what the graph binds — see
    [To Knowledge Catalog](#to-knowledge-catalog).
11. **Vendor-dialect fallback.** What you author is the `expression.dialects[]`
    list; the graph builds from the canonical (BigQuery/ANSI) variant.
    `importedExpression` / `importedDialect` are not authored keys — the loader
    *derives* them from a non-canonical dialect entry (for example the MAQL or
    Snowflake form a metric was imported from) and uses that verbatim as the
    fallback when no canonical variant exists. See
    [Model spec §2.5](model_spec.md#25-expressions).
12. **Actions.** Actions are write-side, so neither graph has a construct for
    them: the push emits nothing for an action and warns once. They are
    published to Knowledge Catalog as one `semantic-action` entry each, under
    the model entry, and `pull` reads them back from those entries. Prototype
    scope: an action's `precondition` and `affects` are not modelled, so nothing
    about them is stored either way. See
    [Modeling write operations](actions.md).
13. **Many-to-many relationships.** The `schema-join` link holds exactly one
    source/target column pair, so it cannot describe an edge that runs through a
    junction table. A many-to-many relationship is published instead as one
    `semantic-association` entry under the model entry, holding the two entities
    it pairs, the junction table, and the junction's keys, join columns, and
    fields. The whole `association` block round-trips — including the edge's own
    fields and their expressions, which are stored unconditionally (the aspect
    type is ours, so it has fields for them; the `--emit-expressions` gate exists
    for the published system templates that do not). See
    [Model spec §2.2.1](model_spec.md#221-many-to-many-association).

## To Knowledge Catalog

The catalog holds metadata rather than a full copy of your model. Every resource
type it uses is a built-in system type under `dataplex-types/global`, apart from
the custom `semantic-association` and `semantic-action` pairs that `kcmd init`
provisions — push references
types, it never creates them (see
[Reference → What gets created in Knowledge Catalog](reference.md#what-gets-created-in-knowledge-catalog)).

What is recorded depends on the push. A catalog-only push (`--no-profile`), or a
purely logical model with no bindings, records the whole model: every entity,
metric, and relationship the document declares. A push that also deploys a graph
first prunes the model to what that graph binds, so an unbound field — and any
entity, metric, or relationship that depends on it — is left out of the catalog
entries too. A pull of such a push returns the bound view rather than the full
authored model.

A logical model still produces complete entries. Each entity's `source` is
recorded empty (`resources: []`) because there is no table behind it, and a
relationship that carries no join columns is skipped with a warning.

By default the catalog does **not** store the SQL expressions: the published
system-type templates do not yet carry a per-field `semantics` block or a
`semantic-metric.expression` field, so the default push omits them. Pass
`--emit-expressions` to write the canonical GoogleSQL/ANSI expression once the
templates gain the fields. The catalog never stores `ai_context.synonyms` /
`examples`, field-level `ai_context` (only model, entity, and metric
`instructions` have a home, in the `guidelines` aspect), or the original vendor
SQL (`importedExpression` — for example the MAQL or Snowflake form a metric was
imported from). Those stay in your authored document; the vendor SQL and
expressions are still used when generating graph SQL.

**Many-to-many relationships** get an entry rather than a link. A `schema-join`
link holds one source/target column pair, which cannot describe an edge that
runs through a junction table, and Knowledge Catalog has no custom *link* types
— only custom entry and aspect types. So each many-to-many relationship becomes
a `semantic-association` entry under the model entry, carrying the two entities
it pairs and the junction table with its keys, join columns, and fields. The
whole block round-trips through `pull`, name included. The entry type is custom,
so `kcmd init` creates it; a model with no many-to-many relationship never needs
it.

**Actions** follow the same one-entry-per-element rule as everything else: each
becomes a `semantic-action` entry under the model entry, carrying its executor
and typed parameters in a `semantic-action` aspect. They round-trip losslessly
through `pull` (name, description, executor, typed parameters, and
`instructions`). Their `precondition` / `affects` are out of scope for this
prototype and are not stored. The entry type is custom, so `kcmd init` creates
it; a model that declares no action never needs it.

¹⁰ What you author is the `expression.dialects[]` list; the graph builds from the canonical (BigQuery/ANSI) variant. `importedExpression` / `importedDialect` are not authored keys — the loader *derives* them from a non-canonical dialect entry (e.g. the MAQL or Snowflake form a metric was imported from) and uses that verbatim as the fallback when no canonical variant exists. See [Model spec §2.5](model_spec.md#25-expressions).

## To BigQuery

Push preserves both the queryable structure and the descriptive metadata attached
to it. The structure becomes the node tables, edge tables, and measures; the
descriptive metadata is written into each element's `OPTIONS(...)` in the graph
(visible with `--print`).

BigQuery's graph `OPTIONS` give an element a `description` string and a `synonyms`
array. `synonyms` is the only part with a dedicated option, so it carries across
structurally, as its own array. The rest — `description`, `instructions`,
`examples`, and a field's `label` — share the single `description` string, so
they are combined into it (examples as an `Examples: …` line). Their content is
preserved; their separate structure is not.

The model's own statement-level metadata has nowhere to go: BigQuery silently
drops graph-statement `OPTIONS`, so the model's `description` / `ai_context` are
not in the graph — the `description` and `ai_context.instructions` are carried
into Knowledge Catalog instead. Unique keys beyond the primary key are also
dropped (only the primary key is emitted). The imported vendor SQL is not carried
as a separate form: the graph builds from the canonical `expression` when
present, and falls back to the imported vendor SQL verbatim only when the model
was never transpiled to a canonical form.

## To Spanner

A Spanner target keeps the queryable **structure** and drops the descriptive
metadata. The node tables, edge tables, and labels (including the `extends`
hierarchy, with fields flattened down) deploy exactly as they do for BigQuery,
but with bare table and graph names. Two things do not make the trip, both by
design:

- **Metrics.** Spanner has no `MEASURE`, so every model-level metric is
  dropped with a warning. The BigQuery-only rule that a metric resolve to one
  entity does not apply. Author your metrics as usual — a BigQuery target still
  emits them, and Knowledge Catalog still records each `semantic-metric` entry —
  they simply have no home in the Spanner graph.
- **`OPTIONS` metadata.** Spanner carries no per-element `OPTIONS`, so
  `description`, `synonyms`, `instructions`, `examples`, and field `label` are not
  written into the Spanner DDL. They still reach Knowledge Catalog on the same
  push (the model's / entities' / metrics' descriptions and `instructions` land
  on their entries and the `guidelines` aspect), so the descriptive layer lives in
  the catalog rather than in the Spanner graph. This mirrors how BigQuery drops
  its graph-*statement* `OPTIONS` while keeping per-element ones.

Everything else — keys, relationships, the label hierarchy — matches the
**→ BigQuery** column above.

**Actions** reach neither graph. They are published to Knowledge Catalog as one
`semantic-action` entry each and round-trip losslessly through `pull` — see
[To Knowledge Catalog](#to-knowledge-catalog).

## What pull recovers

`pull` returns what push wrote — the **Recovered by `pull`** column above is the
summary. When the push deployed a graph, what push wrote was already pruned to
the bound view (see [To Knowledge Catalog](#to-knowledge-catalog)), so pull
returns that view. Two things about *how* it comes back:

**Normalized** — the content survives, the form changes:

- A one-to-many relationship's *name* comes back lowercased/hyphenated
  (`Places Order` → `places-order`); the catalog stores the name only in the link
  id. See [Writer-side follow-up](#writer-side-follow-up). A many-to-many
  relationship is stored as an entry instead, so its name comes back verbatim.
- Field types round-trip except two collapses: a field authored with no type
  comes back as `Opaque`, and a field authored as `String` comes back un-typed
  (both store `dataType STRING`, kept distinct by a field's `metadataType` — see
  footnote ²). A metric's data
  type round-trips only for a concrete type (e.g. `Decimal`); an untyped,
  `String`, or `Opaque` metric comes back un-typed, because the metric aspect
  stores a data type but no metadata type to mark it `Opaque`.
- A field's dimension role (present only if pushed with `--emit-expressions`)
  comes back as a bare `dimension: {}` marker, without its detail (`is_time`, and
  so on).
- Ordering: field order within each entity is preserved, but the order of
  entities and metrics is not — they come back in the catalog's own order, not
  the authored one. Comments in the original YAML are not preserved.

**So a push followed by a pull does not return your original file.** Treat a
pulled document as a faithful copy of the catalog metadata rather than of the
authored model, and keep the authored document as the source of truth.

## Writer-side follow-up

One reduction above is a limit of what push currently *writes* rather than of
what pull can recover. It is recorded here as a write-side follow-up; the reader
(pull) already returns everything the catalog holds.

- **Relationship names** (one-to-many only). The `schema-join` aspect type's
  `metadataTemplate` has no field for the relationship name, so push cannot store it and pull recovers
  it from the link id — which is lowercased and hyphenated (the entry-link id
  format forbids the original casing/underscores). Returning the name verbatim
  requires adding a name field to the built-in `schema-join` aspect type in
  Knowledge Catalog (server-side), after which the client write/read is trivial;
  it is the same class of gap as the `semantics` field that gates
  `--emit-expressions`.

(A non-canonical deployment target is **not** a pull gap: push rejects it at the
validation gate before any leg runs, so it is never written — see
[Validation](reference.md#validation).)
