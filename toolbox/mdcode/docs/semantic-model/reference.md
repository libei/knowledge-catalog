# Reference

Lookup companion to the [deploy guide](README.md): every flag, exactly what push
creates in each destination, the validation checks, and the permissions each leg
needs. For what of your metadata survives a deploy or a pull, see
[What push and pull preserve](fidelity.md).

## CLI flags

### init

```bash
kcmd init --semantic-model <projectId>.<locationId>.<entryGroupId>
```

Provisions the Knowledge Catalog entry group named by the scope (idempotent — an
existing group is fine) and creates its local directory,
`catalog/EntryGroups/<entryGroupId>/`. Author `<model>.yaml` there.

### push

```bash
kcmd push
```

With no flags, deploys to every destination — the model's graph backend and
Knowledge Catalog — the graph first. You do not choose the graph backend: each
model deploys to whichever its deployment target names (BigQuery Graph or Spanner
Graph). The binding profile selects which physical binding feeds the graph, and
that binding's deployment target selects the backend.

A push has two axes, both defaulted so a bare `kcmd push` deploys the graph for
the default binding and records to Knowledge Catalog. The **binding-profile axis**
sets how many profiles the graph deploys for; the **Knowledge Catalog axis** is
whether the catalog leg runs.

| Flag | Effect |
|------|--------|
| `--profile <name>` | Deploy the graph for one binding profile (`<model>.profiles/<name>.yaml`); its deployment target selects the backend. Defaults to `default_profile` from `catalog.yaml`, else the model's inline bindings. Mutually exclusive with `--all-profiles` and `--no-profile`. See [Binding profiles](profiles.md). |
| `--all-profiles` | Deploy the graph for every defined binding profile (plus the inline bindings when the document itself declares a target), instead of a single one. The Knowledge Catalog leg still records one canonical view — the default binding. Mutually exclusive with `--profile` and `--no-profile`. |
| `--no-profile` | Deploy the graph for no binding profile: publish only the logical model to Knowledge Catalog, leaving any deployed graph untouched. |
| `--no-kc` | Skip the Knowledge Catalog metadata push and deploy only the graph the selected profile targets. Knowledge Catalog is pushed by default. A push that deploys no graph (a logical model, or `--no-profile`) can only reach Knowledge Catalog, so `--no-kc` on it is an error, as is `--no-profile --no-kc` (nothing left to deploy). |
| `--validate-only` | Run every validation check and report pass/fail, but write nothing. |
| `--print` | Print each destination's generated artifact (BigQuery or Spanner Graph SQL DDL, Knowledge Catalog entry plan). Combine with `--validate-only` to preview without deploying. |
| `--force-remove` | Delete models in the entry group that this push no longer includes (see [Updating and removing models](README.md#updating-and-removing-models)). |
| `--emit-expressions` | Also write the SQL-expression fields (per-field `schema.semantics` and `semantic-metric.expression`) to Knowledge Catalog. Off by default: the published system-type templates do not carry them yet. Knowledge Catalog push only. |

The graph leg deploys first and fails fast, so a rejected model never
half-deploys.

### pull

```bash
kcmd pull
```

Reconstructs the local model document from the Knowledge Catalog entries. Reads
only from Knowledge Catalog (never BigQuery); its coordinates come from the same
scope you authored under. See [Pull](README.md#pull) for behavior.

| Flag | Effect |
|------|--------|
| `--dry-run` | Reconstruct from the catalog and report what would be written, but write no files. |
| `--force-remove` | Replace a differently-named local model with the catalog's (see [Pull](README.md#pull)); without it, a pull that would leave the entry group holding two models fails. |

## What gets created in BigQuery

`push` executes a single `CREATE OR REPLACE PROPERTY GRAPH` per deployment
target, in the project and dataset the target names. Each part of your model
becomes one part of that graph:

| Model element | BigQuery construct | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| Model | `PROPERTY GRAPH` | named by the deployment-target URI |
| Entity | `NODE TABLE` | backed by the entity's `source` table, keyed by its primary key |
| Relationship | `EDGE TABLE` | connects the two entities' node tables |
| Metric | `MEASURE` on a node table | must resolve to a single entity (otherwise the push is rejected — see [Validation](#validation)) and reduce to one supported aggregate over one operand (otherwise that metric is skipped with a warning) |
| Entity `extends` | extra `LABEL` clauses on the subclass node table | the subclass also matches its supertypes; the supertypes' fields flatten down (see [Class hierarchies](#class-hierarchies-extends--labels)) |
| Action | *nothing* | an action reaches Knowledge Catalog only (see below); the BigQuery push deploys none and warns once |
| Constraint | *nothing* | a constraint reaches Knowledge Catalog only (see below); the BigQuery push deploys none and warns once |

`push` reads the target dataset's location (`bigquery.datasets.get`) so the
statement runs in the right region; without that permission it falls back to
BigQuery's own location inference and warns. Under `--validate-only` no graph
DDL is executed and nothing is written (the live source-table checks still run —
see [Validation](#validation)); add `--print` to see the generated DDL.

For which of your descriptive metadata (`description`, `ai_context`, field
labels, …) lands in the graph and which is dropped, see
[What push and pull preserve](fidelity.md#to-bigquery).

### Class hierarchies (`extends` → labels)

This section is the rules lookup. To model a hierarchy step by step — declaring
it, binding each subtype's table, and keeping supertype counts correct — see
[Modeling class hierarchies](inheritance.md).

An entity that declares `extends: [Parent]` is a **subclass**. BigQuery Graph has
no inheritance keyword, so the push expresses the hierarchy with **labels**: a
subclass node table declares its own default label **plus one `LABEL <Ancestor>`
per supertype**, walking the full transitive chain. A node then matches its
supertype in a query — `MATCH (:Party)` returns every `Customer` and every
`Supplier` node.

You author each entity's **own** fields plus the one `extends` keyword, and the
push flattens the supertype's fields down onto each subclass. The usual
supertype has no table of its own, so mark it `abstract: true`: it has no
`source` and no key, produces no node table, and survives only as a label on its
subtypes.

```yaml
entities:
  - name: Party
    abstract: true             # no table; becomes a label on every subtype
    primary_key: [id]
    fields:
      - { name: id,   datatype: Integer }
      - { name: name, datatype: String }
  - name: Customer
    extends: [Party]           # the one keyword you add
    primary_key: [id]          # each subclass keeps its OWN key; keys do not inherit
    source: proj.ds.customer
    fields:
      - { name: id,   datatype: Integer, expression: c_custkey }
      - { name: name, datatype: String,  expression: c_name }   # the inherited field, bound to this table's column
      - { name: tier, datatype: String,  expression: c_tier }
  - name: Supplier
    extends: [Party]
    primary_key: [id]
    source: proj.ds.supplier
    fields:
      - { name: id,     datatype: Integer, expression: s_suppkey }
      - { name: name,   datatype: String,  expression: s_name }
      - { name: rating, datatype: Integer, expression: s_rating }
```

**The supertype's fields flatten down** onto each subclass. A supertype
contributes its field names to every subclass, ordered own fields first then
inherited, and a nearer definition wins on a name clash. An abstract supertype
binds no columns of its own, so each subtype supplies the column for every
inherited name on its own table — `id` and `name` above are bound on both the
customer and the supplier. A concrete supertype's bound fields flatten straight
down, and a subtype need not repeat them.

**A shared label is reconciled by property name rather than by backing column**
(verified live). Every table that carries `LABEL Party` must expose the same property
names — here `id` and `name` — and each backs them with its own column. So the
push renders each inherited property from the subtype's own binding: `c_name AS
name` on the customer table, `s_name AS name` on the supplier table. A bare-alias
reference such as `PROPERTIES(name)` does not deploy; BigQuery rejects it with
`Unrecognized name: name`.

```sql
`proj.ds.customer` AS Customer
  KEY(c_custkey)
  DEFAULT LABEL
  PROPERTIES( c_custkey AS id, c_name AS name, c_tier AS tier )   -- id and name inherited from Party; tier is Customer's own
  LABEL Party
  PROPERTIES( c_custkey AS id, c_name AS name )                   -- Party's signature, backed by this table's columns
```

```
GRAPH proj.ds.parties
MATCH (p:Party) RETURN p.name   -- resolves on Customer and Supplier alike
```

The boundaries:

- **Fields flow down; edges and keys do not.** A subclass gains its supertypes'
  fields but **not** their relationships or their key: an edge stays bound to the
  exact node table it was declared on, and each subclass keeps its own `KEY` (a
  node table is identified by its own grain, never its supertype's). If
  `Person —livesIn→ City`, a `Customer` node does not get a `livesIn` edge.
- **The subclass's `source` must physically expose every inherited column.** The
  flattened `name` above is read from `proj.ds.customer`, so that table (or a view
  over it) must include the column that `Customer`'s `name` field binds. A
  subclass whose table lacks a column that one of its inherited properties needs
  fails the push when the graph deploys.
- **A shared supertype label carries no OPTIONS and no measures.** A supertype's
  label is bound by every subclass table, and BigQuery forbids a label carried by
  more than one element table from carrying an `OPTIONS` clause or a `MEASURE`. So
  a supertype's own `description`/synonyms are dropped from its label (with a
  warning), and a metric that targets a supertype is skipped (with a warning) —
  attach metrics to a leaf class instead. Subclass and leaf labels are
  unaffected.
- **Each inherited property has one definition under the shared label.** For an
  abstract supertype, the subtype supplies that definition — it binds the
  inherited field to its own column, as `name` is bound above, and that binding is
  used. A concrete supertype already defines the property on its own table, so a
  subtype that declares the same-named field with a different column or expression
  cannot override it: the supertype's definition wins and the subtype's is dropped
  (with a warning). Redeclaring it identically is a harmless no-op.

An entity marked **`abstract: true`** is a conceptual class with no physical
table: it has no `source` and no key, produces **no node table**, and survives
only as a `LABEL` on its concrete descendants. Its field names still flatten
down, and each concrete subtype supplies the column for each of those names, so
the shared label's signature is present on every subtype table. An abstract
entity that no concrete entity extends has nothing to attach to and is dropped
with a warning. `abstract` is an explicit marker: a non-abstract entity with no
`source` is treated as a binding error and fails the push, never
silently dropped as if it were table-less. The Knowledge Catalog leg does not
model inheritance today, so an abstract entity has no physical resource to
catalog and is skipped there (with a warning); its concrete subtypes are
published normally.

A supertype **may** instead be concrete — carry its own `source` and key. It then
becomes both its own node table and a label on its subtypes. Every subtype table
must still expose columns that render to the supertype's property signature, so
each subtype table has to carry the supertype's columns under the same names. The
supertype's own rows and its subtypes' rows are distinct nodes: a real thing
present in both the supertype table and a subtype table is matched twice under the
supertype label. Prefer an abstract supertype unless each real thing lives in
exactly one table under the hierarchy.

**Multiple supertypes and diamonds.** `extends` takes a list, so a subclass may
extend several supertypes and carry every one's label. The push expands `extends`
to the full transitive ancestor set, de-duplicated. A diamond — two supertypes
that share a grandparent — lists that grandparent's label once, so
`MATCH (:Grandparent)` matches the leaf a single time. Depth and breadth do not
change the rules: each concrete table binds every inherited property to its own
column, and these shapes deploy on both BigQuery Graph and Spanner Graph
(verified live for a diamond and for a three-level hierarchy with several
concrete leaves).

## What gets created in Spanner

When the deployment target is a Spanner Graph URI, `push` executes the same
`CREATE OR REPLACE PROPERTY GRAPH` — but generated for Spanner Graph, which
differs from BigQuery Graph in four ways:

| Model element | Spanner construct | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| Model | `PROPERTY GRAPH` | named by the URI's `propertyGraphs/<g>` segment, **bare** (no backticked `project.dataset.` prefix) |
| Entity | `NODE TABLE` | backed by the entity's `source` reduced to its final segment (`proj.ds.Orders` → `Orders`), a table in the target database |
| Relationship | `EDGE TABLE` | connects the two entities' node tables |
| Metric | — dropped | Spanner Graph has no `MEASURE`, so every model-level metric is skipped with a warning; the graph structure still deploys |
| Entity `extends` | extra `LABEL` clauses on the subclass node table | same label-and-flatten handling as BigQuery (see [Class hierarchies](#class-hierarchies-extends--labels)) |

- **Bare table and graph names.** A Spanner property graph lives inside one
  database and names tables in that same database, so the generator emits bare
  names — no `project.dataset.` qualifier on either the tables or the graph.
- **No `MEASURE`.** Metrics are dropped (warned per metric), never errored. The
  BigQuery-only rule that a metric must resolve to a single entity therefore does
  not apply to a Spanner target (see [Validation](#validation)).
- **No per-element `OPTIONS`.** `description` / `synonyms` are not emitted into
  the Spanner DDL; they ride into Knowledge Catalog instead — mirroring how
  BigQuery's graph-level `OPTIONS` is dropped. See
  [What push and pull preserve](fidelity.md#to-spanner).
- **Async DDL.** The statement is applied through the Spanner Admin
  `updateDatabaseDdl` long-running operation, polled to completion (BigQuery runs
  its DDL through `jobs.query`). No region detection is needed — the DDL runs in
  the database the target names.

Under `--validate-only` nothing is applied; add `--print` to see the generated
Spanner DDL. Unlike the BigQuery leg, a Spanner-targeting model's source tables
are **not** probed before deploy — the live pre-flight is BigQuery-only (see
[Validation](#validation)).

## What gets created in Knowledge Catalog

Each element of your model maps to one catalog resource. Every resource type
below except `semantic-action` and `semantic-constraint` is a built-in system
type under `dataplex-types/global` — push references them, it never creates
them. Those two are custom, and `kcmd init --semantic-model` creates them in
your own project at `global`; push still writes only entries.

> Set `KC_TYPE_PROJECT` to read these system types from another project, and
> `DATAPLEX_ENDPOINT` to target a non-prod Dataplex host; both default to
> production (`dataplex-types` / `https://dataplex.googleapis.com`).

| Model element | Catalog resource | Kind | Id |
|---|---|---|---|
| Model | `semantic-model` | entry — anchor / parent of the rest | `<model>` |
| Entity | `semantic-entity` (+ built-in `schema` aspect) | entry | `<model>.entities.<entity>` |
| Metric | `semantic-metric` | entry | `<model>.metrics.<metric>` |
| Relationship | `schema-join` | entry link between the two entity entries | derived from the model and relationship names |
| Action | `semantic-action` (custom type) | entry | `<model>.actions.<action>` |
| Constraint | `semantic-constraint` (custom type) | entry | `<model>.constraints.<constraint>` |

An entity entry carries its columns in the `schema` aspect (name, data type,
description, and any `label` per field), plus the entity's keys and unique keys
(`primaryKey` / `uniqueConstraints`); a `schema-join` link carries the
relationship detail — the paired columns and foreign-key direction — in its
aspect. Any element with `ai_context.instructions` (the model, an entity, or a
metric) also gets a built-in `guidelines` aspect holding that text.

An **action** entry carries its executor, its typed parameters, the names of the
constraints that gate it (`guards`), and the concepts it changes (`affects`) in
a `semantic-action` aspect, along with the action's `ai_context.instructions`. A
guard is stored as the constraint name, matching a sibling `semantic-constraint`
entry on the same model, so a reader holding one action entry can find the rules
it is checked against. An affected concept is stored as its name — an entity or
a relationship, named the same way, since the model is what says which.
That aspect type is provisioned in your project rather than referenced from
`dataplex-types`, because Dataplex has no built-in action type yet; when one
ships, the entries move to it and their shape does not change. (This is the
prototype scope — an action's `precondition` is not modeled yet, and nothing
consumes its `affects`.)

A **constraint** entry carries its rule in a `semantic-constraint`
aspect, together with the whole of any `ai_context` declared on it. The rule
sits in whichever of the two bodies states it — `expression` for a condition a
query can compute, `judgment` for one stated in words because no expression
decides it. The aspect adds a third field, `evaluation`, that no author writes:
it restates which body was used, as `deterministic` or `judged`, so a consumer
picking rules to lower into SQL and a consumer picking rules to hand to a
language-model judge each select on one field. A pull recomputes it from the
body that came back rather than reading it, so the two cannot drift apart. The
constraint's `description` is the entry's own summary, because that sentence is
what a caller refused by the rule reads. Its type is provisioned alongside the action pair and
for the same reason. All three parts of `ai_context` survive, unlike an element
routed to the built-in `guidelines` aspect, which has a home for `instructions`
alone: `kcmd` defines the constraint aspect itself, so it has no reason to keep
that limit.

The aspect also carries the constraint's two routing words: `onViolation` (what
the engine does to the write — `reject`, `escalate` or `warn`) and `severity`
(how grave the breach is — `critical`, `high`, `medium` or `low`). They ride the
aspect rather than the entry source because they are machine-readable and not
prose. A constraint that declares neither is published without both fields and
reads back without them, so the defaults stay the model's to define. Each is
read on its own, so an unrecognized word in one is dropped on pull with a
warning without costing the reader the other: an unreadable `onViolation` falls
back to `reject`, and an unreadable `severity` leaves the rule unranked.

Push to Knowledge Catalog is lossy — the catalog holds metadata, not a full copy
of your model. For exactly what is stored, what is gated behind
`--emit-expressions`, and what is never stored, see
[What push and pull preserve](fidelity.md#to-knowledge-catalog).

## Validation

`push` and `--validate-only` run the same checks, **before either destination is
touched**, so a model that cannot deploy fails fast instead of half-deploying.
Each check enforces a rule the [model specification](model_spec.md) *defines*;
this section is the operational side of it — what the tool does when the rule is
broken — and links to the definition it enforces:

Before these checks even run, the document must **load**, and the loader is strict:
`version` is required and must be `0.2.0.dev0` (vanilla Ossie) or
`0.2.0.dev0/google` (the extended profile); every object is closed, so an unknown
key — including a native key under vanilla, or a `custom_extensions` block under
`/google` — is rejected; names must be unique within their scope; and every
`extends` must name an entity defined in the model. A load failure is reported the
same way as a validation failure — nothing is touched, non-zero exit — and is
defined in [model spec §1](model_spec.md#1-status-and-baseline),
[§2](model_spec.md#2-document-shape), [§6](model_spec.md#6-the-extension-mechanism),
and [§4.1](model_spec.md#41-narrowings-stricter-than-ossie).

* **A graph push declares exactly one deployment target per model, and it must
  be a valid BigQuery Graph or Spanner Graph URI.** A model with more than one is
  rejected, and so is a single target whose URI matches neither
  `//bigquery.googleapis.com/projects/<p>/datasets/<d>/propertyGraphs/<g>` nor
  `//spanner.googleapis.com/projects/<p>/instances/<i>/databases/<db>/propertyGraphs/<g>`
  (for example a `propertyGraph`/`propertyGraphs` typo, or a
  `…/entryGroups/@bigquery/entries/…` entry form). The error names the offending
  URI and the expected forms. A **logical model that declares no target** is
  allowed: it deploys no graph and records to Knowledge Catalog only (so `--no-kc`
  on it is an error — it would have nowhere to go). This gate runs before any
  destination leg, so a malformed target writes **nothing** — not to the graph
  and **not to Knowledge Catalog**; the push aborts with a non-zero exit and no
  entries are created. Defined in [model spec §4.1](model_spec.md#41-narrowings-stricter-than-ossie)
  (one target) and [§7.2](model_spec.md#72-deployment-target) (the URI grammar).
  *(static)*
* **Every metric on a BigQuery Graph model resolves to exactly one entity** —
  otherwise it would be dropped from the BigQuery Graph. Set the metric's attach
  entity, or scope its expression to a single entity. This rule is
  BigQuery-only: Spanner Graph has no `MEASURE`, so a Spanner target drops its
  metrics by design and imposes no such requirement. Defined in
  [model spec §4.1](model_spec.md#41-narrowings-stricter-than-ossie). *(static)*
* **Every action is well-formed.** Each action parameter's `type` must resolve to
  a known entity (an object reference) or a scalar datatype, and each executor
  must carry its coordinates (an `mcp` server + tool, a `rest` endpoint + method,
  a `grpc` service + method, or at least one non-blank `sql` statement) with no
  blank field. A coordinate omitted altogether is rejected earlier, when the
  model is parsed. Each name in the
  action's `guards` must resolve to a constraint that the same model declares. A
  guard resolving to nothing leaves the author believing the write is checked
  when nothing checks it. Every `concept` in the action's `affects` must
  likewise resolve to an entity or a relationship the same model declares, and
  its `fields` must be fields of that concept — for a relationship, the
  properties of the junction table backing a many-to-many edge, so a plain
  foreign-key edge has none. Naming fields beside a `delete` is rejected,
  because a `delete` takes the whole instance. An affected concept that resolves
  to nothing is reported and then left alone, since every later check about it
  is meaningless; undeclared fields do not chain that way, so a concept that
  does resolve reports every field it does not have. Everything that reads the
  ontology — the concept check and the field check both — stands down on a
  profile push, because pruning drops whole entities and whole relationships as
  well as unbound fields, leaves actions untouched, and an action reaches no
  graph in any case; the fields-beside-a-`delete` check reads only the entry, so
  it still applies. A `sql` executor is checked further, because it carries the
  write itself rather than a pointer to whoever performs it: each statement must
  begin with `INSERT`, `UPDATE` or `DELETE`, must contain no `;` other than a
  trailing one, and may reference only `@parameter` names the action declares —
  plus `@new<Concept>Key` for each `affects` entry whose `operation` is
  `create`, which a runtime generates rather than accepting from the caller.
  Together those are what let every value be bound instead of interpolated, so
  an argument cannot reach the store as SQL. Four further rules are enforced at
  parse time: exactly one
  executor kind (`executor requires exactly one kind, but 2 given (mcp, rest)`),
  the closed `create` / `modify` / `delete` vocabulary for `operation`, the
  rejection of a repeated guard name, and the rejection of a repeated
  concept-and-operation pair in `affects`. Every check here is static, so it
  runs on every push, regardless of destination. Note that actions themselves
  deploy **only** through the Knowledge Catalog leg — a
  graph-only `--no-kc` push validates them but has nowhere to put them, and
  warns that they will not be deployed. *(static)*
* **Every constraint states exactly one rule.** A constraint declares an
  `expression` or a `judgment`, never both and never neither. Declaring both
  answers the "can this be computed?" question two ways at once, which answers
  it neither way; declaring neither states no rule at all. Either error names
  the constraint. *(static)*
* **Every expression constraint is checkable.** The `expression` must be
  non-empty. Every `<Entity>.<field>` token in it that names a **known** entity
  must name a field that entity declares, wherever in the expression it appears;
  this catches a typo that would otherwise surface only when something tries to
  check the rule. A qualifier that is not a known entity — a
  relationship-qualified name like `OrderedAs.quantity`, a metric reference, or
  compound logic — is left alone rather than guessed at, so a valid constraint
  is never falsely rejected. So is an entity that declares no fields, since
  fields are optional and a logical model may declare none; an empty list is no
  evidence that a field is missing. So is a token carrying a third dotted
  segment, which is a path rather than a field. A quoted literal is data, so it
  is not scanned.
  *(static)*
* **Every judged constraint says what a violation does.** The `judgment` must
  be non-empty, and `on_violation` is required on it rather than defaulting. Any
  of the three words is allowed, `reject` included; leaving the key out is the
  error, because an unmarked constraint rejects and that is too strong a
  consequence to inherit by silence. Every `Entity.field` token in the prose is
  resolved against the model by the same scan an expression gets, so a field
  name that has been renamed out from under the sentence is caught. Quoted text
  is scanned here, unlike in an expression, where quotes delimit a string
  literal. In prose they more often set off a field name for emphasis, and
  skipping those would hide the renames this check exists to catch.
  *(static)*
* Like an action, a constraint of either kind reaches Knowledge Catalog only,
  and a `--no-kc` push warns that it will not be deployed. Two rules are
  enforced at parse time: `on_violation` and `severity` are each a closed
  vocabulary — `reject` / `escalate` / `warn` and `critical` / `high` /
  `medium` / `low` — so an unrecognized word is a hard load error rather than a
  value that publishes and means nothing. *(static)*
* **An action keeps at least one deterministic gate.** When every constraint an
  action names in `guards` is judged, the model loads with a warning: the action
  has nothing gating it that a query can decide, so each of its guards costs a
  model call that may decide two identical calls differently, and none of them
  can lower to a store-level check. One expression guard among them silences it.
  *(warning, at load)*
* **A constraint over an action's parameters is guarded.** A constraint whose
  expression reads a bare name that is a parameter of some action describes that
  call rather than the stored data, so it can be checked only before the call
  runs — which happens only when the action lists it in `guards`. A model in
  which no action at all lists it loads with a warning, because the constraint
  is text that nothing will ever evaluate. One action naming it is enough to
  settle it: another action that takes a parameter of the same name and does not
  guard the constraint is a modeling choice, since the same rule may gate one
  action and leave another alone. It warns rather than fails because the scan
  matches identifiers, and an expression may use a bare name that merely
  coincides with a parameter name. Neither a qualified name
  (`OrderedAs.quantity`) nor a quoted literal (`status = 'quantity'`) counts as
  a parameter read. The scan reads expressions only: a judgment is prose, in
  which a word matching a parameter name is not a read of that parameter.
  *(warning, at load)*
* **Every entity's source table is reachable.** For a **BigQuery-targeting**
  model, each `source` is probed with a dry-run query, so BigQuery resolves it
  exactly as the deploy will — a three-part `project.dataset.table`, a four-part
  federated REST-catalog name (e.g. an Iceberg table via BigLake), or a quoted
  identifier all work. A table that does not exist or that you cannot access fails
  the push, naming the table and the entity; a `source` that is a query (not a
  table) is skipped. A **Spanner-targeting** model's sources live in Spanner
  (a different system) and are **not** probed here. The `source` construct and its
  URI/dotted forms are defined in [model spec §7.1](model_spec.md#71-table-sources).
  *(live — needs BigQuery access)*

The live table check runs whenever the BigQuery leg runs (some model targets
BigQuery Graph), including under `--no-kc`, because the same tables back both a
BigQuery graph and its Knowledge Catalog entries.

## Permissions

`push` needs access to whichever destinations you deploy to.

**BigQuery** — for a BigQuery-targeting model (the BigQuery leg runs whenever
such a model is present), and for the validation pre-flight:

* `bigquery.jobs.create` in the deployment-target project — to run the deploy's
  `CREATE OR REPLACE PROPERTY GRAPH` and the validation dry-run query
* read access on each entity's source table, so the dry-run can resolve it
* `bigquery.datasets.get` on the target dataset (region detection; optional —
  push degrades gracefully without it)

**Spanner** — for a Spanner-targeting model (the Spanner leg runs whenever such a
model is present), on the database the target names:

* `spanner.databases.updateDdl` — to apply the `CREATE OR REPLACE PROPERTY GRAPH`
  through `updateDatabaseDdl`
* `spanner.databaseOperations.get` — to poll the long-running operation to
  completion

**Knowledge Catalog / Dataplex** — for the Knowledge Catalog push (on by
default; skip it with `--no-kc`):

Writing an entry with aspects needs permission on **both** the entry operation
and each aspect type attached, so a push needs, on the destination entry group:

* `dataplex.entries.create`, `dataplex.entries.update`, `dataplex.entries.delete`,
  and `dataplex.entries.list` — push upserts the model / entity / metric entries
  and deletes orphaned ones
* `dataplex.entryLinks.create` and `dataplex.entryLinks.delete` — the
  `schema-join` links, when the model has relationships
* `dataplex.entryGroups.useSchemaAspect` — every entity carries the built-in
  `schema` aspect (its fields, keys, unique keys, and labels)
* `dataplex.entryGroups.useGuidelinesAspect` — when the model, an entity, or a
  metric carries `ai_context.instructions`
* `dataplex.entryGroups.useSchemaJoinAspect` and
  `dataplex.entryGroups.useSchemaJoinEntryLink` — when the model has relationships
* the `use<AspectType>Aspect` permission for the `semantic-model`,
  `semantic-entity`, and `semantic-metric` aspect types the push attaches — i.e.
  `dataplex.entryGroups.useSemanticModelAspect`, `useSemanticEntityAspect`, and
  `useSemanticMetricAspect`
* `dataplex.aspectTypes.use` on the `semantic-action` aspect type, when the
  model declares actions, and on `semantic-constraint` when it declares
  constraints — those types are custom rather than built-in, so they are
  authorized on the type resource instead of through an entry-group
  use-permission

`kcmd init --semantic-model` creates what a later push only references, so it
needs more than push does, in the destination project:

* `dataplex.entryGroups.create` — the destination entry group
* `dataplex.aspectTypes.create` / `dataplex.aspectTypes.update` and
  `dataplex.entryTypes.create` — the custom `semantic-action` and
  `semantic-constraint` pairs. Init patches an aspect type that is already
  there, so a project set up by an older `kcmd` picks up template additions; an
  entry type that is already there is left alone.

Only the entry-group permission is required. Actions and constraints are
optional constructs, so init reports a refusal to create their types as a
warning and carries on; every model that declares neither still pushes and
pulls. Any other failure to create a type stops init, rather than leaving a
later push to hit an opaque parsing error.

`kcmd pull` needs read access to the same entry group instead — to list its
entries and fetch each `semantic-*` entry with its aspects.
