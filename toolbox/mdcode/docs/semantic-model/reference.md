# Reference

Lookup companion to the [deploy guide](README.md): every flag, exactly what push
creates in each destination, the validation checks, and the permissions each leg
needs. For what of your metadata survives a deploy or a pull, see
[What push and pull preserve](fidelity.md).

## CLI flags

### init

```bash
kcmd init --semantic-model <projectId>.<locationId>.<entryGroupId>
```

Provisions the Knowledge Catalog entry group named by the scope (idempotent — an
existing group is fine) and creates its local directory,
`catalog/EntryGroups/<entryGroupId>/`. Author `<model>.yaml` there.

### push

```bash
kcmd push
```

With no flags, deploys to every destination — the model's graph backend and
Knowledge Catalog — the graph first. You do not choose the graph backend: each
model deploys to whichever its deployment target names (BigQuery Graph or Spanner
Graph). The binding profile selects which physical binding feeds the graph, and
that binding's deployment target selects the backend.

A push has two axes, both defaulted so a bare `kcmd push` deploys the graph for
the default binding and records to Knowledge Catalog. The **binding-profile axis**
sets how many profiles the graph deploys for; the **Knowledge Catalog axis** is
whether the catalog leg runs.

| Flag | Effect |
|------|--------|
| `--profile <name>` | Deploy the graph for one binding profile (`<model>.profiles/<name>.yaml`); its deployment target selects the backend. Defaults to `default_profile` from `catalog.yaml`, else the model's inline bindings. Mutually exclusive with `--all-profiles` and `--no-profile`. See [Binding profiles](profiles.md). |
| `--all-profiles` | Deploy the graph for every defined binding profile (plus the inline bindings when the document itself declares a target), instead of a single one. The Knowledge Catalog leg still records one canonical view — the default binding. Mutually exclusive with `--profile` and `--no-profile`. |
| `--no-profile` | Deploy the graph for no binding profile: publish only the logical model to Knowledge Catalog, leaving any deployed graph untouched. |
| `--no-kc` | Skip the Knowledge Catalog metadata push and deploy only the graph the selected profile targets. Knowledge Catalog is pushed by default. A push that deploys no graph (a logical model, or `--no-profile`) can only reach Knowledge Catalog, so `--no-kc` on it is an error, as is `--no-profile --no-kc` (nothing left to deploy). |
| `--validate-only` | Run every validation check and report pass/fail, but write nothing. |
| `--print` | Print each destination's generated artifact (BigQuery or Spanner Graph SQL DDL, Knowledge Catalog entry plan). Combine with `--validate-only` to preview without deploying. |
| `--force-remove` | Delete models in the entry group that this push no longer includes (see [Updating and removing models](README.md#updating-and-removing-models)). |
| `--emit-expressions` | Also write the SQL-expression fields (per-field `schema.semantics` and `semantic-metric.expression`) to Knowledge Catalog. Off by default: the published system-type templates do not carry them yet. Knowledge Catalog push only. |

The graph leg deploys first and fails fast, so a rejected model never
half-deploys.

### pull

```bash
kcmd pull
```

Reconstructs the local model document from the Knowledge Catalog entries. Reads
only from Knowledge Catalog (never BigQuery); its coordinates come from the same
scope you authored under. See [Pull](README.md#pull) for behavior.

| Flag | Effect |
|------|--------|
| `--dry-run` | Reconstruct from the catalog and report what would be written, but write no files. |
| `--force-remove` | Replace a differently-named local model with the catalog's (see [Pull](README.md#pull)); without it, a pull that would leave the entry group holding two models fails. |

## What gets created in BigQuery

`push` executes a single `CREATE OR REPLACE PROPERTY GRAPH` per deployment
target, in the project and dataset the target names. Each part of your model
becomes one part of that graph:

| Model element | BigQuery construct | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| Model | `PROPERTY GRAPH` | named by the deployment-target URI |
| Entity | `NODE TABLE` | backed by the entity's `source` table, keyed by its primary key |
| Relationship | `EDGE TABLE` | connects the two entities' node tables |
| Metric | `MEASURE` on a node table | must resolve to a single entity (otherwise the push is rejected — see [Validation](#validation)) and reduce to one supported aggregate over one operand (otherwise that metric is skipped with a warning) |
| Entity `extends` | extra `LABEL` clauses on the subclass node table | the subclass also matches its supertypes; the supertypes' fields flatten down (see [Class hierarchies](#class-hierarchies-extends--labels)) |
| Action | *nothing* | actions are write-side and have no graph construct; the push emits nothing and warns once, then publishes them to Knowledge Catalog (see below) |
| Constraint | *nothing* | constraints are checked when an action runs, not read-side structure; the push emits nothing and warns once, then publishes them to Knowledge Catalog (see below) |

`push` reads the target dataset's location (`bigquery.datasets.get`) so the
statement runs in the right region; without that permission it falls back to
BigQuery's own location inference and warns. Under `--validate-only` no graph
DDL is executed and nothing is written (the live source-table checks still run —
see [Validation](#validation)); add `--print` to see the generated DDL.

For which of your descriptive metadata (`description`, `ai_context`, field
labels, …) lands in the graph and which is dropped, see
[What push and pull preserve](fidelity.md#to-bigquery).

### Class hierarchies (`extends` → labels)

An entity that declares `extends: [Parent]` is a **subclass**. BigQuery Graph has
no inheritance keyword, so the push expresses the hierarchy with **labels**: a
subclass node table declares its own default label **plus one `LABEL <Ancestor>`
per supertype**, walking the full transitive chain. A node then matches its
supertype in a query — `MATCH (:Person)` returns `Person`, `Customer`,
`Employee`, and `Manager` nodes alike.

You author only each entity's **own** fields plus the one `extends` keyword; the
push does the rest:

```yaml
datasets:
  - name: Person
    source: proj.ds.person
    primary_key: [id]
    fields:
      - {name: id,        expression: {dialects: [{dialect: BIGQUERY, expression: id}]}}
      - {name: full_name, expression: {dialects: [{dialect: BIGQUERY, expression: full_name}]}}
      - {name: email,     expression: {dialects: [{dialect: BIGQUERY, expression: email}]}}
  - name: Customer
    source: proj.ds.customer
    primary_key: [id]          # each subclass keeps its OWN key; keys do not inherit
    extends: [Person]          # the one keyword you add
    fields:
      - {name: loyalty_tier, expression: {dialects: [{dialect: BIGQUERY, expression: loyalty_tier}]}}
```

For those shared labels to work, **the supertype's fields flatten down** onto the
subclass. BigQuery requires every table exposing a label to expose the **same
property signature**, so a subclass's `LABEL Person` block must list exactly what
`Person`'s own table lists. The push copies each ancestor's fields onto the
subclass (a nearer definition wins on a name clash) so those signatures line up,
and the subclass's default label carries the inherited fields too:

```sql
`proj.ds.customer` AS Customer
  KEY(id)
  DEFAULT LABEL
  PROPERTIES( loyalty_tier, id, full_name, email )   -- own field first, then inherited (flattened)
  LABEL Person
  PROPERTIES( id, full_name, email )                 -- matches Person's own signature
```

```
GRAPH proj.ds.people
MATCH (p:Person) RETURN p.full_name   -- resolves on Customer/Employee/Manager too
```

Four boundaries:

- **Fields flow down; edges and keys do not.** A subclass gains its supertypes'
  fields but **not** their relationships or their key: an edge stays bound to the
  exact node table it was declared on, and each subclass keeps its own `KEY` (a
  node table is identified by its own grain, never its supertype's). If
  `Person —livesIn→ City`, a `Customer` node does not get a `livesIn` edge.
- **The subclass's `source` must physically expose the inherited columns.** The
  flattened `full_name`/`email` above are read from `proj.ds.customer`, so that
  table (or a view over it) must include those columns. Parent and child are
  separate physical tables, so the same real-world entity present in both
  `person` and `customer` appears as two nodes under `MATCH (:Person)` — a
  modeling choice for the binding step, not something the DDL enforces.
- **A shared supertype label carries no OPTIONS and no measures.** A supertype's
  label is bound by every subclass table, and BigQuery forbids a label carried by
  more than one element table from carrying an `OPTIONS` clause or a `MEASURE`. So
  a supertype's own `description`/synonyms are dropped from its label (with a
  warning), and a metric that targets a supertype is skipped (with a warning) —
  attach metrics to a leaf class instead. Subclass and leaf labels are
  unaffected.
- **An inherited field cannot be redefined.** A shared label requires one
  identical definition per property across every table that binds it, so if a
  subclass declares a field of the same name as an inherited one but with a
  different expression, the supertype's definition wins and the subclass's is
  dropped (with a warning). Redeclaring it identically is a harmless no-op.

An entity may also be marked **`abstract: true`** — a conceptual class with no
physical table (so it has no `source` and no key). It produces **no node table**;
it survives only as a `LABEL` on its concrete descendants (its fields still
flatten down so the label's signature is present). An abstract entity that no
concrete entity extends has nothing to attach to and is dropped with a warning.
`abstract` is an explicit marker: an entity left with an unbound `source`
placeholder is treated as a binding error and fails the push, never silently
dropped as if it were table-less. The Knowledge Catalog leg does not
model inheritance today, so an abstract entity has no physical resource to
catalog and is skipped there (with a warning); its concrete subtypes are
published normally.

## What gets created in Spanner

When the deployment target is a Spanner Graph URI, `push` executes the same
`CREATE OR REPLACE PROPERTY GRAPH` — but generated for Spanner Graph, which
differs from BigQuery Graph in four ways:

| Model element | Spanner construct | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| Model | `PROPERTY GRAPH` | named by the URI's `propertyGraphs/<g>` segment, **bare** (no backticked `project.dataset.` prefix) |
| Entity | `NODE TABLE` | backed by the entity's `source` reduced to its final segment (`proj.ds.Orders` → `Orders`), a table in the target database |
| Relationship | `EDGE TABLE` | connects the two entities' node tables |
| Metric | — dropped | Spanner Graph has no `MEASURE`, so every model-level metric is skipped with a warning; the graph structure still deploys |
| Entity `extends` | extra `LABEL` clauses on the subclass node table | same label-and-flatten handling as BigQuery (see [Class hierarchies](#class-hierarchies-extends--labels)) |

- **Bare table and graph names.** A Spanner property graph lives inside one
  database and names tables in that same database, so the generator emits bare
  names — no `project.dataset.` qualifier on either the tables or the graph.
- **No `MEASURE`.** Metrics are dropped (warned per metric), never errored. The
  BigQuery-only rule that a metric must resolve to a single entity therefore does
  not apply to a Spanner target (see [Validation](#validation)).
- **No per-element `OPTIONS`.** `description` / `synonyms` are not emitted into
  the Spanner DDL; they ride into Knowledge Catalog instead — mirroring how
  BigQuery's graph-level `OPTIONS` is dropped. See
  [What push and pull preserve](fidelity.md#to-spanner-graph).
- **Async DDL.** The statement is applied through the Spanner Admin
  `updateDatabaseDdl` long-running operation, polled to completion (BigQuery runs
  its DDL through `jobs.query`). No region detection is needed — the DDL runs in
  the database the target names.

Under `--validate-only` nothing is applied; add `--print` to see the generated
Spanner DDL. Unlike the BigQuery leg, a Spanner-targeting model's source tables
are **not** probed before deploy — the live pre-flight is BigQuery-only (see
[Validation](#validation)).

## What gets created in Knowledge Catalog

Each element of your model maps to one catalog resource. Every resource type
below is a built-in system type under `dataplex-types/global` — push references
them, it never creates them.

> Set `KC_TYPE_PROJECT` to read these system types from another project, and
> `DATAPLEX_ENDPOINT` to target a non-prod Dataplex host; both default to
> production (`dataplex-types` / `https://dataplex.googleapis.com`).

| Model element | Catalog resource | Kind | Id |
|---|---|---|---|
| Model | `semantic-model` | entry — anchor / parent of the rest | `<model>` |
| Entity | `semantic-entity` (+ built-in `schema` aspect) | entry | `<model>.entities.<entity>` |
| Metric | `semantic-metric` | entry | `<model>.metrics.<metric>` |
| Relationship | `schema-join` | entry link between the two entity entries | derived from the model and relationship names |
| Actions | built-in `overview` aspect on the model anchor | aspect (not its own entry) | — |

An entity entry carries its columns in the `schema` aspect (name, data type,
description, and any `label` per field), plus the entity's keys and unique keys
(`primaryKey` / `uniqueConstraints`); a `schema-join` link carries the
relationship detail — the paired columns and foreign-key direction — in its
aspect. Any element with `ai_context.instructions` (the model, an entity, or a
metric) also gets a built-in `guidelines` aspect holding that text.

A model's **actions** have no `semantic-*` system type of their own, so they ride
the model anchor's built-in `overview` aspect: human-readable Markdown for each
action (name, description, executor, typed parameters) followed by an embedded
JSON block that a `pull` recovers them from losslessly. The overview is attached
only when the model declares actions. (This is the prototype scope — an action's
own `precondition` and `affects` are not modeled yet.)

A model's **constraints** ride that same `overview` aspect, under their own
marker: a Markdown section for each constraint (name, description, expression)
followed by its own embedded JSON block. Actions and constraints therefore share
one aspect without overwriting each other, and the overview is attached when the
model declares **either**.

Push to Knowledge Catalog is lossy — the catalog holds metadata, not a full copy
of your model. For exactly what is stored, what is gated behind
`--emit-expressions`, and what is never stored, see
[What push and pull preserve](fidelity.md#to-knowledge-catalog).

## Validation

`push` and `--validate-only` run the same checks, **before either destination is
touched**, so a model that cannot deploy fails fast instead of half-deploying:

* **A graph push declares exactly one deployment target per model, and it must
  be a valid BigQuery Graph or Spanner Graph URI.** A model with more than one is
  rejected, and so is a single target whose URI matches neither
  `//bigquery.googleapis.com/projects/<p>/datasets/<d>/propertyGraphs/<g>` nor
  `//spanner.googleapis.com/projects/<p>/instances/<i>/databases/<db>/propertyGraphs/<g>`
  (for example a `propertyGraph`/`propertyGraphs` typo, or a
  `…/entryGroups/@bigquery/entries/…` entry form). The error names the offending
  URI and the expected forms. A **logical model that declares no target** is
  allowed: it deploys no graph and records to Knowledge Catalog only (so `--no-kc`
  on it is an error — it would have nowhere to go). This gate runs before any
  destination leg, so a malformed target writes **nothing** — not to the graph
  and **not to Knowledge Catalog**; the push aborts with a non-zero exit and no
  entries are created. *(static)*
* **Every metric on a BigQuery Graph model resolves to exactly one entity** —
  otherwise it would be dropped from the BigQuery Graph. Set the metric's attach
  entity, or scope its expression to a single entity. This rule is
  BigQuery-only: Spanner Graph has no `MEASURE`, so a Spanner target drops its
  metrics by design and imposes no such requirement. *(static)*
* **Every action is well-formed.** Each action parameter's `type` must resolve to
  a known entity (an object reference) or a scalar datatype, and each executor
  must carry its coordinates (an `mcp` server + tool, a `rest` endpoint + method,
  or a `grpc` service + method) with no blank field. (The "exactly one executor
  kind" rule is enforced when the model is parsed.) These checks are static, so
  they run on every push, regardless of destination. Note that actions themselves
  deploy **only** through the Knowledge Catalog leg — a graph-only `--no-kc` push
  validates them but has nowhere to put them, and warns that they will not be
  deployed. *(static)*
* **Every constraint is checkable.** A constraint's `expression` must be
  non-empty, and when it opens with an `<Entity>.<field>` qualifier naming a
  **known** entity, that entity must actually declare the field — this catches a
  typo that would otherwise surface only inside an agent's rejected action. A
  leading qualifier that is not a known entity (a relationship-qualified name
  like `OrderedAs.quantity`, a metric reference, or compound logic) is left to
  the evaluator rather than guessed at, so a valid constraint is never falsely
  rejected. Like actions, constraints deploy **only** through the Knowledge
  Catalog leg, and a `--no-kc` push warns that they will not be deployed.
  *(static)*
* **Every entity's source table is reachable.** For a **BigQuery-targeting**
  model, each `source` is probed with a dry-run query, so BigQuery resolves it
  exactly as the deploy will — a three-part `project.dataset.table`, a four-part
  federated REST-catalog name (e.g. an Iceberg table via BigLake), or a quoted
  identifier all work. A table that does not exist or that you cannot access fails
  the push, naming the table and the entity; a `source` that is a query (not a
  table) is skipped. A **Spanner-targeting** model's sources live in Spanner
  (a different system) and are **not** probed here. *(live — needs BigQuery
  access)*

The live table check runs whenever the BigQuery leg runs (some model targets
BigQuery Graph), including under `--no-kc`, because the same tables back both a
BigQuery graph and its Knowledge Catalog entries.

## Permissions

`push` needs access to whichever destinations you deploy to.

**BigQuery** — for a BigQuery-targeting model (the BigQuery leg runs whenever
such a model is present), and for the validation pre-flight:

* `bigquery.jobs.create` in the deployment-target project — to run the deploy's
  `CREATE OR REPLACE PROPERTY GRAPH` and the validation dry-run query
* read access on each entity's source table, so the dry-run can resolve it
* `bigquery.datasets.get` on the target dataset (region detection; optional —
  push degrades gracefully without it)

**Spanner** — for a Spanner-targeting model (the Spanner leg runs whenever such a
model is present), on the database the target names:

* `spanner.databases.updateDdl` — to apply the `CREATE OR REPLACE PROPERTY GRAPH`
  through `updateDatabaseDdl`
* `spanner.databaseOperations.get` — to poll the long-running operation to
  completion

**Knowledge Catalog / Dataplex** — for the Knowledge Catalog push (on by
default; skip it with `--no-kc`):

Writing an entry with aspects needs permission on **both** the entry operation
and each aspect type attached, so a push needs, on the destination entry group:

* `dataplex.entries.create`, `dataplex.entries.update`, `dataplex.entries.delete`,
  and `dataplex.entries.list` — push upserts the model / entity / metric entries
  and deletes orphaned ones
* `dataplex.entryLinks.create` and `dataplex.entryLinks.delete` — the
  `schema-join` links, when the model has relationships
* `dataplex.entryGroups.useSchemaAspect` — every entity carries the built-in
  `schema` aspect (its fields, keys, unique keys, and labels)
* `dataplex.entryGroups.useGuidelinesAspect` — when the model, an entity, or a
  metric carries `ai_context.instructions`
* `dataplex.entryGroups.useOverviewAspect` — when the model declares actions or
  constraints (both ride the anchor's built-in `overview` aspect)
* `dataplex.entryGroups.useSchemaJoinAspect` and
  `dataplex.entryGroups.useSchemaJoinEntryLink` — when the model has relationships
* the `use<AspectType>Aspect` permission for the `semantic-model`,
  `semantic-entity`, and `semantic-metric` aspect types the push attaches — i.e.
  `dataplex.entryGroups.useSemanticModelAspect`, `useSemanticEntityAspect`, and
  `useSemanticMetricAspect`

> The `schema` / `guidelines` / `schema-join` use-permissions follow Dataplex's
> documented `dataplex.entryGroups.use<AspectType>Aspect`
> [pattern](https://cloud.google.com/dataplex/docs/iam-permissions); the
> `semantic-*` names follow the same pattern but are not yet in that public
> reference (the `semantic-*` system aspect types are newer), so confirm them
> against your project's IAM once granted.

`kcmd pull` needs read access to the same entry group instead — to list its
entries and fetch each `semantic-*` entry with its aspects.
