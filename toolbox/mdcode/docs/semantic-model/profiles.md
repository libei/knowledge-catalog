A semantic model describes a business logically — its entities, the
relationships between them, and the metrics over them — independent of where the
data physically lives. A **binding profile** maps that one logical model onto a
concrete set of sources. You keep the model as a single canonical definition and
select a profile per scenario; a profile changes only where each entity reads
from, never what the model means. Because every profile shares one model,
`Customer`, `revenue`, and each relationship mean the same thing whichever
profile serves them.

## Why a model gets more than one binding

The same concept usually lives in more than one system, and a profile binds the
model to one of them. The systems differ along whatever axis matters to you:

- **Different backends for different consumers.** A live operational store —
  AlloyDB, Spanner, a SaaS API — holds the `Customer` an agent reads to check
  current state before it acts, and writes back to. An analytics warehouse such
  as BigQuery holds a copy of that same `Customer`, scaled for reporting, that
  dashboards and conversational-analytics agents read. One profile binds each,
  and every consumer inherits the same metric definitions, so `revenue` is
  computed the same way wherever it is asked.
- **Different environments of one backend.** A dev, staging, and prod copy of one
  store are three profiles that differ only in the project they point at.
- **Different physical layouts.** The same model can bind a table exported to
  files in a lake, an Iceberg copy, or a partner's differently-named schema.

A profile is a named binding, and its meaning is yours to decide; the cases above
only illustrate the range. You author the model once and choose the profile when
you deploy or query.

## How it works: a logical model and its bindings

A model and its profiles form a class hierarchy, the same way an entity
`extends` a supertype:

- The **logical model** (`<model>.yaml`) is the **base**: the complete
  declaration — entities, fields, relationships, metrics, the grain, and the
  graph shape — with no physical binding.
- A **binding profile** is a **subclass**: a document in the *identical schema*
  that supplies the physical facets the logical model leaves open — each entity's
  `source`, each field's column, and the deployment target.
- `kcmd push --profile <name>` **merges** the profile onto the logical model —
  matching entities, fields, relationships, and metrics **by name** — and
  deploys the result. A profile is never deployed alone: the logical model
  supplies every declaration, and the profile supplies the bindings its store
  provides.

Because the two share one schema, a binding may also sit inline in the logical
model as a profile named `default`. The layout on this page keeps the logical
model standalone and each binding in its own file, so the split between logical
and physical is visible on disk.

## Sources are URIs

Each entity names where its data lives with `source`, a URI. A Google Cloud
source is an [AIP-122](https://google.aip.dev/122) resource name —
`//bigquery.googleapis.com/…`, `//spanner.googleapis.com/…`,
`//alloydb.googleapis.com/…` — read with ambient IAM. Anything else is a
`scheme://…` URI, such as an `iceberg://…` table that the deployment manifest
resolves to an endpoint. A profile moves an entity between stores by swapping
this URI, and — when the two stores shape the data differently — the column each
field reads.

## What a profile may change — the contract

A model separates two things. **Declaration** is logical: which entities,
fields, relationships, and metrics exist, what each means, how each metric
computes, the grain, and the graph shape. The logical model owns all of it.
**Binding** is physical: which store each entity reads from, which column each
field reads, and how each action performs its write. A profile sets binding and
leaves declaration alone.

| A profile **may** set (physical binding) | A profile **may not** touch (logical, in the model) |
|---|---|
| an entity's `source` (its store URI) | which entities, fields, relationships, metrics, or actions exist, and what each means |
| a field's column (its `expression`, a bare column reference) | a field's `label`, `description`, `dimension`, `datatype` |
| whether a field is bound at all under this profile | the grain (`primary_key` / `unique_keys`) and graph shape (`from`/`to`, `from_columns`/`to_columns`) |
| an action's `executor` (how the write is performed) | an action's `parameters`, `guards`, and `affects` — what it takes, what gates it, what it changes |
| the deployment target | a field `expression` that is arbitrary SQL, which changes the computation; any `metric` definition; any `ai_context` / synonyms; a relationship or its junction `source` |

An element's `name` is not overridden — it is the key that pairs a profile
element with the model element it binds. The grain and the join columns name
*fields* rather than physical columns, so they belong to the logical model; each
field's column is resolved per profile from its `expression`.

**Why an action's executor is a binding.** An action declares what a call does:
its parameters, the constraints that gate it, and the concepts it changes. *How*
the change is carried out depends on the store. Where the rows sit in a
relational database, the write is DML; where they do not, it is a call to
whoever owns them — an MCP tool, a REST endpoint, a service method. Even between
two relational stores the statement differs, because each binds its own table
and column names and each speaks its own dialect. So the `executor` sits with
`source` and `expression` on the physical side: the same action, the same blast
radius, performed by whatever mechanism the bound store actually has.

Whether a write is *reviewed* is a property of the environment too, and lands in
the same place. A profile can bind a `proposal` executor where the store holds
production data, so the write is composed at call time and passed to a reviewer,
and leave the staging profile writing DML directly — the same declared action,
gated in one environment and not the other.

**An executor inherits; a column does not.** A model may declare one default
executor, and a profile overrides it only for the stores that perform the write
differently — an action the profile does not mention keeps the default. This is
the opposite of a field's column, which a profile must restate or leave unbound.
The asymmetry is deliberate: a column inherited into a renamed schema binds to
the wrong data and returns it silently, while an executor names a whole
mechanism, so a wrong one fails at the first call rather than answering. To
withdraw an inherited executor — a read-only binding that performs no writes at
all — a profile writes `executor: null`, which leaves the action declared and
unavailable there.

**Why metrics never appear in a profile.** A metric like
`SUM(OrderedAs.extendedPrice * (1 - OrderedAs.discount))` references field
*names* rather than columns. Field names are stable across profiles — only their
column bindings change — so the metric is correct under every profile where its
fields are bound, without being restated. Where a field it references is not
bound, the metric is unavailable under that profile; the next section explains
why.

## Availability follows the bindings

A store holds what it holds. An operational database keeps a customer's live
credit; a warehouse keeps a modeled lifetime value; neither carries the other's
column. A profile binds whatever subset its store serves, and leaves the rest
unbound.

What a profile can answer is therefore derived from what it binds, by one rule.
**A building block is available under a profile when every field it depends on is
bound there. When any input is unbound, the block is unbound too, and so is
anything built on it.** Availability propagates up the dependency graph from the
fields a profile binds. The chain runs as far as the model does:

- a field is bound when the profile gives its column;
- an entity is available when its key fields are bound — a graph node must be
  keyed, so an entity whose key is unbound is dropped whole, and every
  relationship and metric that touches it falls with it;
- a metric is available when every field its expression references is bound and
  every entity it spans is available;
- a relationship is available when both endpoint entities are available and the
  join columns on both ends are bound; a cross-entity metric over it is available
  only when the relationship is;
- an action is available when a binding supplies its `executor` and every concept
  it names — the entity type of each parameter, and each concept in `affects` —
  is available. An action with no executor is declared and not performable here;
  one whose parameter type is unavailable has nothing to resolve its argument
  against, so binding an executor would not make the call work.

So an operational-only field such as live credit carries its operational-only
metrics with it, and a warehouse-only field such as lifetime value carries its
reports; each is present where its inputs are, and unavailable everywhere else.
The logical model still declares each thing once; a profile answers the part of
it that its store can back.

**Unbound is not null.** A bound field whose data happens to be empty — a
customer with no phone on file — is null: the field exists and the value is
missing. An unbound field does not exist under that profile at all, and anything
that reads it is unavailable there rather than reading a null. Keeping the two
apart is what lets a query fail against a store that cannot answer it instead of
returning a blank that reads like real data.

**A profile binds only what its store serves; the rest is unbound.** A profile
is authoritative for the model's physical bindings: a field the profile gives an
`expression` is bound, and a field the profile omits is unbound — there is no
separate flag. (Selecting a named profile also clears any column binding written
inline in the logical model, so the profile alone decides what is bound; the
logical model stays where meaning is declared, the profile where columns are.) So
the operational profile below binds `availableCredit` and omits `lifetimeValue`,
and the analytical profile does the reverse. A field's absence is not silent: a
metric or relationship that needs an unbound field is reported as unavailable
under that profile. When the source table a profile binds is missing or
inaccessible, validation fails and names it; a mistyped column name resolves to a
real table and so surfaces at deploy, when BigQuery rejects the generated graph.

## File layout

A binding may also sit inline in the logical model — logical and physical in a
single file — which is how the `default` profile works, and a model with one
binding needs nothing more. Keeping them in separate files, as below, is one
layout among several: it keeps the logical model reusable across bindings and
lets each binding be reviewed and owned on its own.

The logical model is one file, and its bindings live beside it, one file per
profile:

```
catalog/EntryGroups/commerce_eg/
  commerce.yaml                  # the logical model — declarations only, no bindings
  commerce.profiles/
    analytical.yaml              # bindings for the analytics warehouse
    operational.yaml             # bindings for the operational store
```

Each binding file is a `semantic_model` document in the same schema as the
logical model, carrying only physical facets. `--profile analytical` reads
`commerce.yaml` plus `analytical.yaml`, so nothing in one binding can affect
another.

## Example — one model, an analytical and an operational binding

The logical model declares the business and nothing physical: no sources, no
columns, no deployment target. `lifetimeValue` and `availableCredit` are both
declared here, though no single store carries both:

```yaml
# commerce.yaml — logical model
version: "0.2.0.dev0/google"
semantic_model:
  - name: commerce
    entities:
      - name: Customer
        primary_key: [key]
        fields:
          - { name: key,             label: Customer ID }
          - { name: name,            label: Customer Name }
          - { name: lifetimeValue,   label: Lifetime Value }
          - { name: availableCredit, label: Available Credit }
      - name: Order
        primary_key: [key]
        fields:
          - { name: key }
          - { name: customerKey }
          - { name: orderDate, dimension: {is_time: true} }
    relationships:
      - name: PlacedBy
        from: Order
        to: Customer
        from_columns: [customerKey]
        to_columns: [key]
    metrics:
      - name: order_count
        expression: COUNT(Order.key)
      - name: avg_lifetime_value
        expression: AVG(Customer.lifetimeValue)
    actions:
      - name: CancelOrder
        description: Cancel an order that has not shipped
        parameters:
          - { name: order, type: Order }
        affects:
          - { concept: Order, operation: modify }
        # The default: ask the service that owns orders to cancel one. Any
        # binding that does not hold the rows itself uses this.
        executor:
          mcp:
            server: //agentregistry.googleapis.com/projects/acme-ops/locations/us/mcpServers/orders
            tool: cancel_order
```

The analytical binding points the model at the BigQuery warehouse. The warehouse
carries the modeled `lifetimeValue` and does not hold live credit, so
`availableCredit` is left unbound (omitted below). It says nothing about
`CancelOrder`, so the action keeps the default executor: the warehouse reports
on orders but does not own them, and cancelling one means calling the service
that does.

```yaml
# commerce.profiles/analytical.yaml — BigQuery bindings
version: "0.2.0.dev0/google"
semantic_model:
  - name: commerce
    deployment_target: //bigquery.googleapis.com/projects/acme-analytics/datasets/sales/propertyGraphs/commerce
    entities:
      - name: Customer
        source: //bigquery.googleapis.com/projects/acme-analytics/datasets/sales/tables/customer
        fields:
          - { name: key,             expression: c_custkey }
          - { name: name,            expression: c_name }
          - { name: lifetimeValue,   expression: c_ltv }
          # availableCredit is omitted -> unbound under this profile
      - name: Order
        source: //bigquery.googleapis.com/projects/acme-analytics/datasets/sales/tables/orders
        fields:
          - { name: key,         expression: o_orderkey }
          - { name: customerKey, expression: o_custkey }
          - { name: orderDate,   expression: o_orderdate }
```

The operational binding points the same model at the live Spanner store. Spanner
holds the same customers under different table and column names, binds the live
`availableCredit`, and does not carry the modeled `lifetimeValue`. It also owns
the order rows, so it overrides `CancelOrder` to write them directly instead of
calling out:

```yaml
# commerce.profiles/operational.yaml — Spanner bindings
version: "0.2.0.dev0/google"
semantic_model:
  - name: commerce
    deployment_target: //spanner.googleapis.com/projects/acme-ops/instances/prod-us/databases/commerce/propertyGraphs/commerce
    entities:
      - name: Customer
        source: //spanner.googleapis.com/projects/acme-ops/instances/prod-us/databases/commerce/tables/Customer
        fields:
          - { name: key,             expression: CustomerId }
          - { name: name,            expression: FullName }
          - { name: availableCredit, expression: AvailableCredit }
          # lifetimeValue is omitted -> unbound under this profile
      - name: Order
        source: //spanner.googleapis.com/projects/acme-ops/instances/prod-us/databases/commerce/tables/Orders
        fields:
          - { name: key,         expression: OrderId }
          - { name: customerKey, expression: CustomerId }
          - { name: orderDate,   expression: OrderDate }
    actions:
      - name: CancelOrder
        # Overrides the model's default: this store holds the rows, so the
        # write is DML against them. Only the executor is restated; what the
        # action takes and what it changes stay in the logical model.
        executor:
          sql:
            statements:
              - UPDATE Orders SET Status = 'CANCELLED' WHERE OrderId = @order
```

Neither binding restates the grain, the `PlacedBy` relationship, the labels, or
the metric definitions; those live once in the logical model. `kcmd push
--profile operational` merges the operational bindings and deploys to their
Spanner backend, while `--profile analytical` deploys to BigQuery — each profile
picks its own backend. The two bindings answer different parts of the same model:

- `order_count` depends only on `Order.key`, bound under both bindings, so it is
  available under either.
- `avg_lifetime_value` depends on `Customer.lifetimeValue`. The warehouse binds
  it, so the metric is available analytically; the operational store omits it, so
  it is unbound there and the metric is unavailable.
- `availableCredit` is bound only operationally, so it — and any metric written
  on top of it — is available under the operational binding and absent under the
  analytical one.
- `CancelOrder` is available under both, and performed differently by each: DML
  operationally, an MCP call analytically. One declaration, one blast radius, two
  mechanisms.

## Merge rules

- A profile carries `entities` (its alias `datasets` also works) with their
  `fields`, and `actions` with their `executor`; these merge onto the logical
  model **by `name`**. A profile never carries a `relationship` or a `metric` —
  those are logical, so they live once in the model and a profile that sets one
  is rejected. An action entry that sets anything but `name` and `executor` is
  rejected the same way.
- An entity or field named only in the logical model keeps its declaration,
  but any inline column binding is cleared unless the profile re-declares it;
  a profile element whose `name` is not in the logical model is rejected.
- Scalars — `source`, `expression`, `deployment_target` — **replace**.
- A field the profile does not bind is **unbound** under that profile — selecting
  a profile clears the logical model's inline column bindings, so only what the
  profile binds is bound. There is no `unbound` flag; omission is how a field is
  left unbound.
- An action the profile does not mention **keeps** the model's executor, if it
  declared one. Omission inherits here rather than unbinding, so a model can
  state one default and a profile override only where the write differs;
  `executor: null` withdraws it explicitly.
- Profiles are **binding-only**: a profile sets physical facets and may leave a
  field unbound. It cannot add or remove entities, fields, or metrics, change
  the grain or graph shape, or change what anything means.

## Command line

```bash
kcmd push                                 # deploy the graph with the default binding + Knowledge Catalog
kcmd push --profile analytical            # deploy the graph with the analytical bindings (BigQuery target)
kcmd push --profile operational           # deploy the graph with the operational bindings (Spanner target)
kcmd push --all-profiles                  # deploy the graph once per binding profile
kcmd push --profile analytical --no-kc    # deploy only the graph, skip Knowledge Catalog
kcmd push --no-profile                    # publish only to Knowledge Catalog, deploy no graph
kcmd profiles                             # list profiles, their resolved sources, and what each cannot answer
```

`--profile` chooses **which physical binding** feeds the graph, and that binding's
`deployment_target` selects **which graph backend** the model deploys to
(BigQuery Graph or Spanner Graph). You never name the backend on the command line
— picking the profile is picking the backend. The binding-profile axis (how many
profiles the graph deploys for: `--no-profile`, the default, `--profile`, or
`--all-profiles`) is separate from the **Knowledge Catalog** axis (`--no-kc`).
Both default on; `--no-profile --no-kc` together is an error (nothing to deploy).

**Deploying to more than one binding at once.** `--all-profiles` deploys the graph
once for every defined profile — for example the analytical (BigQuery) and
operational (Spanner) graphs in a single run. Knowledge Catalog still records one
canonical view of the logical model — the default binding — so a bare `kcmd push`
and a `kcmd push --all-profiles` write the same catalog entries and differ only in
how many graphs deploy.

There is always a **default binding profile**: whatever `default_profile` names,
or — if it is unset — the model's inline bindings (the implicit `default`
profile). Because `default` names those inline bindings, it is reserved: a
`<model>.profiles/default.yaml` is rejected rather than silently ignored. Set the
default so a bare `kcmd push` in CI does the right thing, in `catalog.yaml`:

```yaml
scope: semantic-model.acme.us.commerce_eg
default_profile: analytical
```

## Validation

Profiles are checked as part of push; `--validate-only` runs the checks and
writes nothing.

- **Unknown profile** — `--profile stg` when `stg` is not defined fails and lists
  the profiles that are.
- **Missing or ambiguous target** — a profile that deploys a graph must resolve
  to one `deployment_target`.
- **Declaration override** — a profile that sets a `label`, `dimension`,
  `ai_context`, a `metric`, the grain, a relationship's `from`/`to`, or a field
  `expression` that is not a bare column reference is rejected, naming the
  offending path.
- **Unknown name** — a profile element whose `name` is not in the logical model
  is rejected. Profiles bind declarations; they do not add them.
- **Unresolvable source** — the BigQuery table a profile binds is probed with a
  dry run; a table that is missing or inaccessible fails and names it. Column
  names are not probed here — a mistyped column resolves to a real table and is
  caught at deploy, when BigQuery rejects the generated graph.
- **Availability summary** — push resolves the dependency graph and prints, per
  profile, how many entities, metrics, relationships, and actions the binding
  leaves unavailable. `kcmd profiles` lists each one with the reason that stops
  it, so withheld coverage is stated rather than discovered later. Actions are
  listed apart, under `cannot run:` rather than `cannot answer:`: an action a
  binding drops is not a question it cannot answer, it is a write it cannot
  perform.

## Notes

**The deployment target is a first-class key.** Under the extended
`0.2.0.dev0/google` profile — the version these binding examples use —
`deployment_target:` is a native model key, so a profile sets it readably. The
vanilla `0.2.0.dev0` profile has no native key for it; there the target rides in a
`GOOGLE` `custom_extensions` block instead. The two are the same target written
two ways, chosen by the document's `version` (see [model
spec](model_spec.md#1-status-and-baseline)).

**Bare-string expressions.** A field's `expression` may be written as a one-line
string (`expression: c_name`) instead of the full per-dialect object. The two
forms mean the same thing and expand to the same wire representation.

**Dialect comes from the store.** A profile carries no SQL dialect. The dialect
follows from the store a profile binds to; the engine lowers each `expression` to
that store's query language when it runs. A profile chooses the data, and the
execution engine chooses the dialect.
