// Lowering a constraint to a probe.
//
// A probe is a SELECT that returns the rows breaking the rule, so an empty
// result means the rule holds. Two things are under test: the SQL a given
// expression turns into, and -- at least as important -- which expressions are
// refused. The lowering fails closed, so every refusal here is an action the
// runtime will decline to run rather than run unchecked, and each one has to
// say enough for whoever wrote the model to fix it.
//
// No store is involved. A probe is built from the model and the action alone,
// with the arguments left as parameters, which is what lets the same call
// answer both "may this action be offered at all" and "what shall I run".
