// Behavior specification for deriving agent tools from a model.
//
// The claim under test is that a model already carries what an agent needs, so
// an agent framework adapter has nothing left to invent: the tool's name, its
// description, its parameter types and the guidance a caller should follow all
// come out of the model. These tests read those out and check them, and check
// the outcome mapping an agent reads after a call.
//
// Nothing here opens a Spanner transaction. Deriving the tools is pure, which
// is the point: what an agent is offered can be checked without a database.
