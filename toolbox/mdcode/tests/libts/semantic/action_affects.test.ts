// Behavior specification for an action's `affects`: the concepts a call
// changes, its blast radius.
//
// Nothing in the model can derive this. An executor is an opaque handle to an
// MCP tool or an HTTP endpoint, and no reader can see what that tool writes, so
// the blast radius is declared or it is unknown. That makes `affects` unlike
// every other cross-reference in the model: it is the author's claim, and the
// only thing checking it is the check written here.
//
// Two authored shapes reach the same IR. A bare name is the coarse claim the
// proposal document uses -- this concept is touched, in some way not spelled
// out. A record adds an operation and the fields it writes. One key and one set
// of verbs cover entities and relationships alike: an edge with properties of
// its own is modified exactly the way a row is, and nothing downstream branches
// on which kind a name turned out to be.
